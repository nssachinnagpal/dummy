 Conditional debugging ...sometime we put flag into applicaiton ..wherever we need to put things
 Debug logs get displayed or get generated 

If u want to split logic between classes then go for handlers 
Like pbhandlers

Attribute tables ..metadata ..data abouy data

SOI writer 

Merge file concept ...same file with 2 names ..multiple files get created
Tech concept. .one thread creating file ..it got terminated at same time other thread take responsibility 

Sybase is built on java and it is very secure 


Bouncy castle ...

Encoding we do basically for certificate enhancement

Tomcat /jdk
Java.policy ..standard file for permission 
java.security ..file for encyrptiom 

Java predefined provider for security enhancement 

If we pass security provider then hacker comes to know pre provider so.this causes security leakage ..so we used to change priorities and add our security provider 

Spring security framework using bounty castle 

SQL server has capability to send emails directly from databases
Indexing also done at table 

Denormalization ...data where redundancy is there

Normalization ... redundant data is minimized 

Zero contact delivery ...service 2 creating file and put into FTP location
Service 1 ..picking same file and process  it

Problems .servixe 2 is .placing file at FTP location and service 1 reading same file so it won't read properly as data will be corrupted

And other issue like data loss 

Checksum ..binary format data ...which check whole file is transfered or not 

32 system ..NTFS ...compress system 

Secure FTP ... SFTP 

JSCH ..library for SFTP ...pure java implementation of Ssh2

.SSH ...host keys 
We can generate ssh keys 
Public and private 
Public and private keys 

Public key ..system 
Private key....bitbucket 

So along with window login ...your bitbucket login successfully


YouTube/Netflix ..using streaming services ..streaming API 
Apache common ..FTP
JSCH ..jcraft ...SfTp

Compress ...zip form
Stream ..byte form ...binary data 

What are the areas of improvement ..feedback 

As business logic are distributed over different layers so we can move to cloud as everyone moving to cloud .....CPS/cues perspective

Quartz framework ..job processing 

Framework ..one is framework to support complex 
Other is to go with custom clases ..which gives lot of flexibility 

Message diges t...what message we need to send 

Splunk.....used to search and analyze machine data 
Report generation 
Monitoring 
It used to search log files. ..check how many request coming etc ..main work of splunk is what data is coming in request/response 


Grafana ..is tool like kibana which used to show request /load on system 
If we want to checkdata on server

Netstate...give port status and everything

Stash changes ...
W... Forward ....WF ..windows forward slash

Windows back slash is always double ...\\

One country may have different marker 


Dialect.  Middleware ...if we want to convert one object to another like soap service hosted on C# and consumer is consuming from java MAp so basically we have convertors 

If string coming then what will be equivalent DS in java 

 Ref system is using concept of iframes 
They used to create frame inside one page 

I-frame ..it's obselete now ..nobody using

Advantage ..single URL is there ...no URL change on top which means no relapsing of page ..common CSS ..Ajax calls under i-frame are easy 

Now we r using concept of tiles ...alternative to i-frame 

Spa ..single page application
MVC ..tiles like structure is used 
Event based architecture

Multitier application with multiple jar and wars .It is kind of enterprise application deployed into weblogic

Xstream. Is java library to serialize objects into XML ...kind of converter but not at response level

Jackson API supports only JSON format 

Synchronization queues ..insert operation must wait for another removal of item by another thread 
Threads used to maintain in executor pool

Ref specific ..one handler is assigned to one thread  and thread pool used to maintain both 
Handler data will remain intact with thread pool data
Handler is basically used to split logic across different classes 

When shutdown request raised then it will check status of threads running in executor pool so it will wait for sometime ..so it will close first and then shutdown 






How server will ensure that response came back to server is in same format which it requested intially...that is via concept of thread local

==================================================================================
t2
 
 Rest template ..is part of spring used to provide basic nessccesities to have rest API call


When we submit on callable statement it used to return future object 

Call methods () 
.submit ..it will return future object only 

Redis server ...session management at server side 

Profing concept ..Dev ..uat 
Basically spring used concept of profiling 

As we moving towards docker ..image created which rotates across all system 
There will be no config file so image will be pure image ..so when lookup is performed so it will go to particular location so it get different files based on request like uat Dev prod 

@values ...get things from application properties file 

By constructor /setter ..things get setup properly 

Beauty of spring ...we can override things at any time 
Beans initialized properly or not 
Programming ..we can make changes at run time in any bean or code


ADP ...SALARY MANAGMENT COMPNAY
Company payslip comes via ADP SOFTWARE 

design pattern ..code smell..


Behaviosec.com...words on AI for security enhancement

Jstio ...cloud deployment

Jstio .. At a high level, Istio helps reduce the complexity of these deployments, and eases the strain on your development teams. It is a completely open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. It is also a platform, including APIs that let it integrate into any logging platform, or telemetry or policy system


3 beans created for thread management 

Command line runner ..like if any argument if I want to execute something at time of initialization like seed data or like application start

Command Line Runner is an interface. It is used to execute the code after the Spring Boot application started.
First ...bean intialization
Second ..autowiring 
Np exception we get on console

Command line runner ..used to execute code when spring boot applicaiton get started 

Let say error comes at bean intialization so we have to shutdown or forceful exit ..which may cause crash 
Gracefully exit is always recommended
Another level of uncertainty

Atlast ..we r sitting on the calls and it's very dieing state 

Application runner 
Interface has 2 arguments 
No-optional
Optional

@postconstruxt ..propertset ..we can use to set properties at time of bean initlization

Some fields shared at dB and some at codebase ..that is purpose of loadpropeties  intializator 


Adaptor is like convertor 
My mobile is with c pin type
My charger is of d -type 
So we need convertor which is basically adaptor

Handler r class build to perform specific operation

Xsd is metadata of XML
FTL ..free Marker took...alternative to JSP...FTL used for dynamic content 

Dynamic beans are only in struts 

Runnable method run  always returns
 null
Callable always return future object

Horizontal lb Vs vertical LB
When data is high then go for horizontal load balancer
When no of request is high LIKE REQUEST/RESPONSE CHAIN then go for VLB

One thread for batch update 
Another thread for fetching data 
Third thread for connection
4th thread for cache update


Thread draining concept in refdata 
When performing operation  on queues and making call it will unload all elements from queue and load to another collection  it will drain out the queue so shutdown of things gracefully and safety exit of thread

Properties ..inside service meta data is being passed to every thread 

One thread is attached to one property ...whenever any update happen thread get activated
....thread is pointing to handler..handler is responsible to handle changes ..being done by bean ...whenever change in handler ..thread get activated...scheduler is maintained to load all threads in cache

Compass mongodb ..client 

_------+verify below content/online-------++

Microservice disadvantages that multiple instance running due to which log generated at multiple servers and difficult to track /monitor as don't know which request passed from lb1 /lb2/lb3

due to which Elk comes into.picture and centralised logging/searching/monitoring

-----+–--------_-----+---_____________------------


Clusters r replicas in database

Microservice has no state in itself it is restless 

Dedb  is denomralized table database are used for temporary tables

Everytime I fetch data from database ..it create query object so.more consumption/memory 
Momentic queries are going on 

When system start ..we generate basic queries (select ..insert...update) and put into cache

Temporary tables created and get passed into SP and when operation performed then close tables 

Everywhere we r using batch(it won't be momentic) when data is high ...threads we r using because there must be UI to show something 

Arraylist ..let say it's not implementing serialization ..we get new arraylist ..we will never know type of objects inside arraylist 

So we do deep cloning where we iterate particular objects to get type of objects ..(read and write objects)


Serialization we r saving state of object so there is no way to save partial state of object like I want to serialize some properties but not all properties to save/serialize etc ...can cause performance issues 

So externalisation comes into.picture as it is controlled by programmer where we can save partial state of object 

Java has option of transient

We initialize object by autowiring

Class a super class
Class B extends a 

B= new  b right
B= new a ...wrong 
A= new b right
A = new A right 

Schema ..will be created on top of cluster

====================================================================================
t3/mongodb
 
 3 level security

UI level ..whatever data we get from client ..SSL

HTTP URL dealing ..we deal with certificates 

Middlelevel ..process data via encyrption


Database layer ..using certificate ..we can secure txn related data 

2 ways handshake certificates 

API ..can u share payload 
Cluster can have many database

But one cluster will connect to one database  

Mongo is alternative to jdbc template


Concept ...sometime we want to  hide some methods 
Core methods 
Public version 
Private version .. implementation

So we don't need to change implementation everytime
So we just use parameters in public and change return of this method 

Mongodb 
It is documented style so we r using JSON here 

Everyid has unique id  document ...total no of records
One document is considered as one row 

On left side ..collections

Document metadata will be of object 

Analyze under schema ..u will see it is having type ...bson ..key value type

How many documents are available in collection per instances 

Write query into form of objects 
And criteria will add into query ..filters we apply 

$lt ,$ GT...less than and greater than 

Consider whole collection as one table 
There is no link btw collection/database

No multiple tables ..no sp..no join we have in mongodb

Java provides 2 version of mongodb
Java asynch Mogo
Java syn mongo

We have read and write concern in mongodb 

Write concern.. ..minimum it will write in one of the cluster ...min majority concerns


Read concern(local available majority) ..it is send to database but it doesn't return acknowledge (dont know whether it is inserted or not )


If we r working with replicas then at least acknowledge for one of the replicas 
Mongo.has no primary/foreign key relationship

Just we have primary key thing in mongo

JSON format is easy to read 

Indexes we can create whichever field we are fetching frequently

Ttl ..time to leave ..creation of index after particular time 


Power Bi..tool for generating reports

Whenever there is requirement of bulky  data then we use mongodb as intermediate dB and backend as Sybase database

Aggregation ..it shows status of collection
It shows preview of document 

100 column... I need 40 columns we put lock/rules on those columns ..when user is inserting data it should consistent across everywhere 

Shading concept ..which is used to partition on basis of hashkey region zones 

Deep cloning ..copying elements from one dB to another dB one by one 

Shallow cloning ..we just copy entire object of arraylist to another database

Txns run under thread ...imp concept 

Txn manager .. propagation is for 
Propagation has value and requirement 

There can be n number of txn manager used to define in properties like mode ..inherit

Fetching data from.multiple tables ...SP work


Stored procedure is class in spring 

Storing into temporary tables and triggering tables via SP and indexes

Rollback for cache ..own created customized exception class

Models r basically pojo 

JMS ..we used to maintain status 
System become bulky 
So we used to clean table time to time via handler /services


=====================================================


t4/reaxt
 
 Any class we r passing inside provider ..state get maintained under stores 

Maps states to props ..whenever state changing ..below.methods get called 
Map states to props 
Map dispatch to props

above is Standard way to do.mapping between redux and react 

Redux is kind of internal understanding thing

Dispatch used to call redux 
Once there is change in properties ..we have provider ..it.keep on checking
Provider get activated once store some values


Dispatcher keep on pinging if any change in state ...it used to check current action 

3 dots (...) ...used to flatten an array
Whatever properties in props it will pass all properties 


Prop{1}
Prop{2}
Prop{3}

Pass current ....action ...give new states

Promise .... It returns and check current state of call

Dispatch method is used to convert promise object to data 

We will get data out of promise object using dispatcher method

Relevance of this mapping to props ... syncing state with the props and making call to redux ...here when prop  changes then once state changed then virtual ROM .get changed 

Root reducer ....component for combining 

Parent class ...contain all reducer...root reducer.js

Redux ..saga...think
Configure store.js ....this configuration is required whenever we add redux related stuff 

Jar is minified version so compression happens 

Compression happens when distribution happens across the teams
Which gives compiled and static files


Webpack contains many more functionalities

Tomcat ..localhost :8080 
Index.html ..it.is static file 
Tomcat ...run...then serving at local :8080/index.html

Same case with serve ....cues new gui 
Convert the distribution project (cues ..newgui) into static code 
This is kind of way we can migrate ..small code 

So we put static code of cues new gui 
Into profilegui
So we added static code of new gui into.profilegui 

Inside proxy ..PAC files 
How web browser and other user agents can automatically choose approximate proxy server for fetching given URL 

IT people can control whole system without informing you 

head recursion and tail recursion 

2 ways to call method 

One method ..itself calling ..it will be infinite until reaches condition

Top to bottom ...head recursion
Bottom to.top ...tail recursion 

Init.d ...it's a standard file used to be ther in any Linux environment

Like tomcat we got .exe in window but in Linux we don't get any .exe 
So we used to put in folder 

Zip folder ..tomcat window ..manually we have to set services via class path etc

But it's kind of Automatic startup used to put in services

Declarative way to set tomcat in Linux env 

Init.d ..put files in folder where we want to automate the services 

Tomcat Bin foldr ..contains startup files like ....(.exe) ...
Lib ..library files 

Webhooks ..SSH
if we want to use rest API ...if I want to get info from Jira ...Jira provides end point


Linux has internal users until we login those user are admins and manage system automatically 

Sudo ..allow user to execute command as super user 

3 types of deplyoment

Manual
Time based 
Commit based 
  Manual ....Deployment can be done via FS autosys 

Time based ..we schedule crons jobs ..it will run Jenkins also have jobs ..it will fire at particular timestamp 

Commit based ..whenever commit in respository the deployment process has been called
Webhook used to fire script that commit has been done .. Jenkins will decide it will go for deployment or not 

Logg error ..bottom to top tracing  ..for class check


3rd class called by 2 ..called by 1st

Log types ..access logs ..error logs ..debug logs

(Check config) ..command used to activate and deactivate services in Linux

(..list )...command 
It displays all system services whether they r ON or OFF

version .control.....it takes updated last version

======================================

t6/cues /
 
 Stunning ..we want to interact with service at client end ..we create stubs 

Enumeration ..by default singleton object can be used /called anywhere

For singleton ..key and value both r singleton in nature 


Lazy way intialization ...get created when called first-time 
Eager intimation ..get created when class get initialized


Charet symbol/regex ..they have different significance ...one slash means there is one value after one slash etc 


Old jars ..index created ..as repository jar retrieval is much faster ..reindexing of code into local

Kaitlin ..language built on top of java 
It's very fast ..
Groovy never throws exception ..works like JavaScript 

Kotlin and groovy are very popular nowadays 

Kotlin... (.KT) files
Val is like variable in java 

Ahnotificationprocessor ..set of instructors 

Hitting JMS server 

Subscribing publisher ..hitting JMS server if message is received or not


Values corresponding to user is refreshed ..then it is going to acknowledge a Boolean value ..true 

Ahnotificationprocessor
Cuesnotifcationprocessor

Bridgebackprocessor ....updating localdb and if user related data via service 

Cip UI made in react JS going  TO INTERTACT WITH cip war 

React ...everything like button /field etc is a component in react JS 

Redux ..for maintaing state of applicaiton..it is add on component of react JS 

How they will interact with text ..what is the current state ...What is the next state ...it takes help of reducer 

Suppose I click on one link and what is next state that will come from action
After action ...comes to reducer 
Reducer is change of state 

Detail entered after submission what will be the next state 

Stores ..when state is changed stores used to fetch data ...it means state is migrated from one state to another so data is saved into stores

Like car given going from one place to another ..so I need petrol to go at destination so petrol is working as input for stores To render data on UI

Every component extends react component 

Props ..keyword ..take value from one component to another
Render ..method to render but only return single value at time 


Render method is compulsory in all components 

Request popup.  Component in react JS for popup

Passing values from one component to another ..we have props ..states 

Vibrifaction 

Force update if snapshot ..maven ..if any beta version is ther ..it.will update 

Selinum one 
Cues application convert into script
Script ..we have we drivers /jars which used to communicate between browser and script when we run script 
Then it will automatically open browser given in jar and open URL then run /test  cases automatically ...mouse hover automatically seen

Creditional based keys 
U can login and it will check for SSH keys 

Concept of public and private key 

Vi ..command for editing 

We need to tick in mind that is part of change 

Named queries ..are static queries used by hibernate ..we r using in case of complex queries 

Build UI to add resources on the fly...more kind of control.on business side

==============================
t5
 
 Maven clean ..compile class ..remove target ..check all.dependencies 


eclipse:eclipse ...it used to re-arrange the things ...show source code 
It always look for package structure 
It will automatically configure buildpath 


Jax-ws includes ...Apache axis 2 and wsdl 


Product based company ..one swimming pool and you have to dive into.that ..if you won't swim properly ..you will die 


Service based company ...load with resources with all technologies ..go to.client and look for sifferne project ..want to enhance ..shift to.new technology ..couple of years on one project and then shift to another project 

Apache axis 1 ,Apache axis 2 ,Apache CSF came into picture 

Servlet context ..when we deploy things ..servlet context even get fires and this get loaded automatically

Python ...machine learning ..AI ..dataset 

Java haven't reached to that level but machine learning and datasciene went so ahead 

To create diagram of project ..think.out of box

Daily stand-up call...sprint 2 weeks 

Python syntax has been developed I such a way that we can use in AI ,machine learning ..data science 

Spring context ..is itself named as applicable context 

In java all files are treated as objects 
Spring context or application context is container which contains all beans 

At run time ..we execute and get objects

Calling code of service ...is client 

2 means of service 

Service located at other locatioon 
Or  service located in project itself 


XML schema is ..xsd


Xstream. ..it is used to serialize objects to XML and back again ..like AC to DC and DC to AC 

Mule ..now it is webservice used for service oriented architecture

Lifecycle of bean ..Intialize process destroy

Any change required at dynamic time ..we can use propertyset method 

Check if value is not assigned it will throw errors 

Entadmin call ..one is delete call and another is save call

Damon thread is background thread. ...only main thread can close Daemon thread

Jms services /queues..based on concept of producer and consumer  

Service is pushing data into JMS and this consuming where other is producing 


Cpswebservice ..opened with jdcore ..option in eclipse

Helper classes ...kind of until classes

Region ..is kind of gemfire object which maintain details of cache region for that particular data ..when we try to fetch data it go to.paritulcsr region and fetch on basis of filter

How we create cache  for first time 
@1 Use our own data 
@2 Put into cache system


Body part in postman  is payload 

End point which is exposed to us which we using that is wsdl


Activemq implements JMS 

Messaging queue ..Kafka ..rabbit mQ..active mQ
2 approaches ..broadcasting 
Producer and consumer 


Active mQ used for heterogenous client 
Like producer code in java
Consumer is in python

Kafka don't support distributed system 

Distributed system like bank branches  ..WhatsApp(cost terms are normal like WiFi)

Centralised system ..Core banking system ,ISD calls if we go other country then roaming cost terms

Tibco ..interact with dB / application/mainframe by automatically routing and transforming information in appropriate format to respective destination

Entlib ..central point ...generics way to decouple functionality

Helper classes ..different method ..new change required ..we just change helper classes


Kibana ...to check performance of application ..centralised login system

They gave vague description

Pfid can be same for two fund account ..one to.many relationship

Any changes coming from entwervuce to profile logdata ..it get update in logs


Cob server ..are small backup instances which can run upto 2-3 days

Befor making any changes ..we r saving current profile into entservice
===========================================================
t7
 
 Olap ...provide env to retrieve data from multiple databases 

Oltp ..process data provided by olap


Top ...command used to check prices

Informatica... .tibco ....tools used for data mining 

Deep refreshing ..deleting everything from cache and load all data 

Soft refreshing ..based on filter/condition we load updated data 


Legacy things works fine ..not breaking any belt 

API ...kind of jar ..any programming language we can create API
But if you need to interact over internet ..webservice is needed

===========================================

t8
 
 Myfitapp.com
Gym ..logo feature of gym 

iOS .. application takes 3 days to pu lush onto.playstore 

Cockpit ..admin module ..with help.of this it takes very less time 

Beacons ..low energy Bluetooth devices ...work on Bluetooth technology
WiFi beacons ..shopping mall..Amazon 

Everywhere beacons are used 
In gym ..publish push message via beacons


Concept to check out forward or backward slash

Path separator 
Line separator
File separator ..developer use method to set slashes automatically

Windows ...\\...black slash 
Unix ..forward double slash 

OSWAP top 10 ..open. Web application security project

Cockpit ..is place where you have access to all the things 

CBS is cockpit where all features r available

Hl7 ...health for.at 
Ccx .. commercial capture express


Selenium ...before and after class concepts ..selenium works on xpath concept 

Multiple tomcat ..
Like we have multiple tomcat in one system 


Cpswebservice ..context ...adding all
Context of all beans loading dynamically

Means dynamically we r loading Bea s 

Static bea. Intialization ..properties files 
Dynamic beans ..via program 


Version ..maintaining at some.other side

We r not maintaining   parent child  relationship 

At major release ..parent pom.is there ...we maintain release version 

If we do change in pom ..all.child ..whoever using this project will be reflected 
So it's kind of overhear to developers 

Query builder ..help to build query

Batch ..programming ...running in loop
It takes all data from dB ..it's in loop that's why we call it as batch 

CPS cues ..perspective ..always service hitting dB to load data into cache


Company provided propriety database ...
Flat databases ...no SQL we call flat databases because there is no rows and tables



==============================================================================================================================
refside daily
 
 Cygwin ...used to create Linux container 
 
 Mime mapping types ...like I only allow JSON/XML ...restricting things in tomcat ..web.xml

 Test suite ..it work on relative path mean short path Not absolute path 
 
 DWR ...it is Google library for Ajax calls which now has been shutdown ..basically Ajax calls tjo get data from server and render on UI 
 Very secured and high performance library

 Chat applicaiton .. e-commerce ..screen sharing applicaiton can be handled by DWR

 NEATOR IS also framework like DWR Struts ...first framework ..it is basically MVC architecture it maps mapping with POJO MVC flow starts with struts Mapping manage in XML which used to handle actions Dynamic forms inside XML

 If you see action name in URL we can say/check in struts Code is written on server side but accessibility is available at client side

 Advantages ...client will.never know which file server we r connecting 
 
 Front store applicaiton ..warehouse applicaiton. ..all data managing at same location DROOLS ..to make ruleset on server side Example ...let suppose application has type of admins 
 Frontend admin Super admin Backend admin
 Set of URL ...so I want to restrict the URL on types of admin so use drools to apply filter 
 
 X86_64 architecture. Means runs for both Exclude tag in pom

 RM command ..remove all files under folder 
 
 Poatbuild and prebuild changes can be done via pom.xml and ant.build .xml

 Dbcp is for connection pooling 
 
 Free marker tool ..is an alternative to JSP In serialization and deserialization ..read and write objects 
 When over network ..request and response object DO.....IF we r using read and write objects and overriding while doing serialization SON Serialization and deserialization we need to save state of object while dealing over network

 Java object cloning using copy constructors and defensive copy methods ..certainly have advantages but we have to explcility write some code to achieve deep cloning Deserialing a serializsed object created new object with same state so similar cloning appprwches we can use to achieve deep cloning functionality Cloning object using serializatio comes with some performance overhead ...we can improve by in-memory serialization and no need to.persistt it in file for future purpose 
 Unlike the shallow copy, a deep copy is a fully independent copy of an object. . A shallow copy of an object copies the ‘main’ object, but doesn’t copy the inner objects. The ‘inner objects’ are shared between the original object and its copy The problem with the shallow copy is that the two objects are not independent. If you modify the Name object of one Person, the change will be reflected in the other Person object. These kind of things will be defined in XML 
 XML has concept Cdata If we pass data in any language then it will be parsed .. btw these tags ..syntax error will be ignored
 Email template will be put in Cdata Generally we out all error message into hashset 
 
 
 Generally data handlers are close to service layer
 
 
 ==========================
 
 refside
 
 Dataprocess service ... 

Stop file concept ...

Email ack concept 


Hikari ...used for connection pooling ...when we startup applicaiton ..it used to create connection at starting of applicaiton ...it will.keep on reusing connections as we don't close connection ..we keep on reusing 



Create ..cpc3, hikari ,dbcp

Connection pooling library ...no datasource library

=================================

refdata notes 
 
 3 critical things needed 

Data foundation on CPS we give clients accntd 
Securities and pricing from ref day side 

We r giving pricing from PMC..end of the day 

We don't give real time price /data because prime finance is broker ..we don't take client order and make changes ..actual order processing is done by us  which include ..trade settlement ..clearing .. reporting ..comission ..profit loss calculation

Let say ..100 Tesla security to buy..go to.broker  and Citi as a broker 

Newyork stock exchange 

What's the best price 
Who want to sell

When price match happend ..trade is formed

Tesla..... Price we r using 

Last closing day ..closeup business day 

There PMC ..pfref data start

Different stock exchange bonds etc 
PMC ..does all magic and apply pricing rules 
What rule should I apply 
Bitprice...closing price 


Waterfall.model...any kind of override 


PMC ...send different ranking price 

1 security may have 14-15 different  lines of prices 
Except matrix system 

Prime use rank one price 

We only capture rank one price and distribute to consumers 

For matrix ..we distribute different prime lines 
Matrix has own logic to pick and choose 

SOI TABLE S..SECURITY OF INTEREST

Let says 1000 security needed so they will send file via batch

Ref combines all soi and send that back to PMC ...ref proces files and store into staging 

PMC will cut file with price and apply rules and then generate extract

In pricing theory ..zero.price is actual price by default ...we don't set any price 

We as refdata pick rank one price

Dashboard to show batch files .
Multiple batch 
Apac batch 
Delta batch 
Nam batch 

When all trading done in Australia/Japan market ..then batch start

Similarly when uk London exchanged get closed then batch start 

Nam batch ..when NY exchange closed it/batch start around 11 est

Every trade has to be reported to security exchange comission by law


Good thing ...we use autosys ..
Issue ..autosys ..every job takes 7-8 minutes 

Adding delay...it created bottleneck 

Breakdown 

Java process consume all soi 
Combines all SOI
Citi identifier 
Enrichment ..try to enhance 
Security ..add all identifier

Dashboard show like waterfall model

SMC ..PMC  model cames in Citi solved many thing earlier every body using this own set of security/pricing 


Prime finance is front face to client 

Behind scene ,subledger actual settlement

SMC ..capturing info from secure

Security flow ...pricing is real time 
Syncup with AMC

Optimus prime ..trading platform for prime ..op call refdata to check in and thwn go to SMC and get info and push to Optimus prime

FTP ..service where it used to keep file


============================================================================================

spring hateos/neo4j
 
 In hateos we can directly access model via URL  ..no need of creating controller etc

We get JSON response ..one class handling everything 

Spring competier ...dropwizard  

Spring patching has to be done on open source ..free system

Java paid support is also available in market and available for every other language 

Defacto standard ..QWETY KEYWORD is one of example

Hateos response ..it is self explanatory
Parent href child href links
Rendering order of particular user is self explanatory 

Hibernate ..lazy loading concept 

Let say I have employee department accnt info

Object in memory but not rendering all.info
So.hibernate is used to take care then it will hit database again to load other info

Spring hateos ..self explanatory objects more flexible

Neo4j ..4 level hiearchary ..graphical database ..4 level graph diagram ..it is used in AI


CMD ..powershell


U asked Amit to apply leave on behalf of you


========================================================

spring security 
 
 Spring flyway..versioning maintenance

When we migrate from 1 version to another 
Flyway ..database migration.tool

Like 7 tables in SIT env and 8 tables in prod
So we have script to.migrate 
Checksum /hashcode generated at dB side 

Suppose table structure is different in SIT.AND PROD ..7 TABLES VS 4 TABLES

use repair command to fix checksum issue

Project facets in properties of project 


How versioning is maintained ..version migration ..checksum version ..description

Dml have restore points ..that's why we create logs 

Non txna and txn data will.be different 
Springs used to maintain own txn management 
Txn mode ..managed by datasource  ...
Eg ..alter..update delete insert queries etc

Non txn mode.. automatically create itself independently instead of dependent on spring ...eg ...select queries


Rollback can be applied via Aop 

Remember feature of creditionals
Session management ..timeout 

Concurrent session is one the property which spring holding ..cannot login.twice thrice ..like Netflix ..IRCTC .limited to login/screen
ABC.com/admin
ABC.com/employee
Swing support multithreading we have to.implemwnt it 

Other framework handle it automatically 


Swing wants all thread in JVM
 Multithread in swings for authentication ..new session will be created which will create issue ..one user will have multiple session ..that's why we want all threads at same place in JVM 
So we cannot implement multithreading in swing in simple way


Important ..

Developer By default logged in  ...cps

I don't know who logged in my system
But I added join point to get login details
Joinpoint cannot be tracked 

Company will never know until it track email of user
 

Spring security topic 

Multiple ways to.handle session
SSO Token 
User creditiomals 
In memory 
Database 


Spring secrutiy provided authorisation authentication at joint point level

Secure object model
Method invocation 
Join point 
Filter invocation

Localisation..I want to host  site indifferent countries and maintain samesite across gloabe so we add localisation 

Site in French ..France 
Site in hind language ..India

Man in middle attack ..some people attack sever to fetch user creditiomals

Authentication at application site can be stolen ...solution ...once authentication is successful we create session token..once authenticated we used to clear creditionals

We cannot delete session token otherwise we cannot handle session request and response 



In -memory authentication. ...like tomcat
Users.xml
Server.xml
Catilina.xml

Application which show status of application is kibana which is using inmemory authentication

Application context path is like /root
 Root of application where it is hosted

Deny  by default ...(***). Wild card search

Filteration ..set of filters customize filter chain 


Httpresources ...

request response ..CSS...is 

Interceptor filters
Many application don't allow pdf to download ,in this case we create interceptor ..mention pdf not allowed ..it is called interceptor filter 

Exception translation filter . ...when my application want to translate exception coming then use exception translation filter 

Security context persistence filter ...it clears the details of thread local

Basic authentication filter
Digest authentication filter


Cookie is site based
If you are opening data by client side 

Remember me. ... Create cookie ..save into local ..private key created on server ...once login it will check cookie available on system ...it.eill send cookie to server from local.


Forwarded ip's  are those IP which r bounced IP ..we try to bounce IP from one location to another 

When login ..session token get generated ..2nd page get rendered when we get session token from previous page 


1st login ..session I'd 
2nd login ..otp ..valid successful
Then we will delete session I'd and another session I'd will.remain logged-in for time 


1st session id is input to 2nd login 

Now companies used to give draft ..no session ...

Post call ..and I go back it will throw exception

Neo4 j ...are meant for online txns ..more clarity btw business and developer


Corrine Siri Alexa ...Ai implementation

Townhall meetings...product marketing ..citi is thinking to launch ai robot and TCS came to know about this so.tcs came with proposal that we have 100+ employe.e with AI skill set
Instead of sending 100 employee ..they will send 15 employee to recognize the pattern 

Intially we had no rule related to cookie
To store any data on client side but now it's rule ...accept cookie rule 

There can be n no of cookies as cookie is site specific 

Opening site from.mobile ..desktop..tab it will.be different and server used to know this information via ((user -agent))

When cleitn request then user agent get auto..attached 


Locale is system based info
Locale is location based


DHCP work on static and dynamic IP

Cisco used to provide internal software which provide range of system that software will generate list of static IP

Amazon S3 storage thing over web

Dynamodb ...cloud dB 
S3 buckets 
Data storage solution 

Amazon S3  provide soap and rest interfaces 

No ui available ...go via postman 

? Value = ,?URL= 
Running on local check this point 


Flask ..run on version more than python 3.0

Comet ..framework for chatting application 


Watchdog ..when we r doing development we cannot restart server everytime

Watchdog ...Linux environment watch dog used to check 

Watchdog used to replace files for hotcode swapping

Sybase is too secure but have performance issue 

Regex ..forward double slash means single slash only ..just an example ...it depends on case by case

For loop ...3 lines

ABC.foreach(system.out :: println)


Cache has expiry time ..

50

Data migration code migration ... infrastructure migration

Rollback plans

Rowmapper...internal method of jdbc template ..used to.map.the result data to pojo and return object 

Gemfire ...distributed software system used to maintain cache

Cache is file which is used to.maimtain on server 

Picture ..combination of audio and sequences of images

Cache ..we can extract data from cache instead of making call to database 


Extension used in struts ...xxx.do


CDN content delivery network through which multiple request can be addressed 

Cabionline ..shopping cart

Religare


Poc proof of concept 

Telemetrics .commercial capture express ..it is Most advanced technology ..no one can hack 
Shopping cart ..txn gone through ccx 

Risk analysis ..bank defaulters on basis of EMi ..able to fulfill loan or not 

Txn database never kept in database ..X937 FILE FORMAT WHWRE WE KEEP BANL TXN DATA

Secure banking ...CBS ..secure banking txn 


Modify rating scale ..every country rating 
Every bank rating 
Modify KPMG
Compositors off ..comoff

Crid in CPs == relclient I'd in cues


========================================

ribbon client 
 
 One service handling 100 request ..in case it get 101 th request ... It won't entertain it will break circuit 

It will check number of

Once it goes beyond particular request it break circuit 

If rest template r using it has to be load balanced

It used to work as circuit breaker 

 Ribbon use internally 
 Heartbeat concept 

Instead of server hitting client 

Client register themselves with server


====================================

orchestration /tomcat/jenkins
 
 Orchestration basically provides you environment or resource for microservice architecture automation
 
Sort of DevOps 

Orchestration process ..we setup environment what microservice required ..setting up 

LET SAY we are building 50 times in day ...whole day building ...so we have Jenkins to automate 

Starting we used to do manual build 
Devop profiles ..one team who is automating process ...

All across company ..DevOps team will create small functionality 
Eg ...
Git checkout .. 
end of the day pull ,release pull
We r pushing code to repository ..hooks are there ..jenkins
 It used to provide one layer of security 
 We r not loggim into server ...we are giving to jenkin to deploy.in particular env where 


Sonarcube ,fortify ...SCA
Fast lane , ...android application automation
Build deployment , automation 
Application log maintenance 





I am running out of work ...you can assign some work 

Sonarcube ...we used to give path 


Owasp 10.. standard defineds which defines quality of product ..benchmarks setup by company ..that is the reason we go with SCA

Tomcat/ jenkins

Clear 


Tomcat sourcode .... El language  
Patching will always be on method of classes ..requirement was to implement custom.pagination in jsp

Type of object for which we have to do pagination

List of ..instead of passing from SQL 
We will pass list to jsp ..
If we don't want to.make database call again ..if we'were not able to hold database objects so we applied customisation server pagination at tomcat level


==========================


java mail api/kafka
 
 Mail id 
SMTP server 
Authentication 


Web server has one important property  called as catch all

2 types of email.id 
Global.email.id available to outside world 
Local I'd cannot send to outside world

When email comes it comes to POP3 server ..it check for.name and match name with alias and internally it will be running and send to alias 

POP3 server which wil have catch all functionality

Scenarios 

Pankaj@apple.com and pankaj don't exist in apple so email comes to apple till POP3 server ..server use that email and send email to admin email server 

2nd scenario
Pankaj1 ...internal email
Pankaj...external email

1st mapping is to mail id and 2nd mapping is to alias 

Pankaj1 send email ...log generated

Server will check pankaj1 is mapping to something in config file ..once mapping Good it will open firewall and send email to Pankaj and pankaj further send to user ..this is how sender authentication works 
FTP ..22
SMTP ..25
POP3 is post office protocol used to receive email.from.mail.server 





Network.calls expect TLS 1.2 .with jdk 1.8..TLS is network protocol with jdk 1.8



Jmeter 

Binaries ...bin


Kafka consumer..it's JMS took

Broadcasting ..producer and consumer

JMS depreciated broadcasting 

Active.mQ..Apache mQ

Kafka feature ..easy to setup ..synching capability... run in cluster..can be setup in distributed env


Previously active mQ used to keep.lot.of jars but in kalfka we use stream API for exchanging data

Consumer used to split data into task ...divide into chunks and store in task format

Notification server..ahfrontagent are independent but there is possibility of delay as there is momentic difference when msg receive and consume 

But in kafka we have streams so there is no delay

Producer and consumer don't wait for anyone ..producer produces and consumer consumes because of streaming concept 

1 broker where multiple topics running 
Topic internal has streams 
Topics are split into partition and it will r
 be replicated  across brokers
Societygenerale bank famous in implementing Kafka 

All open sources starts with org

Open sources ..free version and other is commercial version 

On concurrency ..we need to write down lot of codes so java provides concurrent API 


Firebase ...nosql database by Google authentication and authorisation taken care by Google 

Amazon divided into ecommcer ...we services ..telemetrics
Telemetrics is way to track the way we drive  the car
They automated via alexa 

When we used to start application we need to check step by step 
Lot.of connection objects,
 need to read..allocate some.memory 
Server load is very hight at time.of startup ...intial data is initialozed or.not as this is the main reason of checking service intially


===========================================================

react1
 
 Below.is cip spcefic 

When intialization we used to setup context ..when app get started it used to read content data from context ..

It will create map...key value pair 

XML parsing is fast 

Putting queries in XML and setup in form of key value pair

 Velocity is an API of Apache ..so we parameter passed from UI should be formatted with velocity parameter 

We r generating querie at run time so SQL injection hacks not possible 
At run time we do multiple joins and get multiple queries 

FTL ...free marker tool 

All intialization files configurations are loaded via query annotations 


Mutlipart request ...if we passing file from UI to service or transferring data of several types then that is multi part request Whever file handling...we should handle it very carefully 



Fuzzy logic /search ..if I am passing string value instead of integer so it should handle both properly


 Type referencing ..take any of collection type and do subclassing map ,integer 

Cip ..webhooks

 2 types of webhooks Commit based hookup Schedule based hookup 


Maven is an intermediate agent who.is taking care of compilation using java It basically copy files from source to target ...

if sometime you face issue build not.proper ..then delete target folder Pom...it cannot build files at parent Level ..maven compiler run on source ..it picks data from.source and copy it to.target 


mojo ..maven old java object Mutable map ..everytime it create new instance 


Rest app...firewall...backend app(cip) 


Firewall check.if it's coming from system or not if all certificates are passed it will allow to talk to CIP and check controller request is good or.not then further it go to Dao If going to service then we should ask for requestparam If it's coming from service then path variable 


Elastic search is a service running on server ..running on particular location/port returning a object of Elastic search RESPONSE handler ..returns some data 

Search is going to be called by user ..so we should add on if we have to perform some action on search 

Common task related to search is implemented by AOP Cost cutting system ..whenever making a call ..common data is used to get rendered is done by AOp Elastic search ..document type search ..we can access via API ..using API we can search document Router ..router.js 



Ecosystem ..whereever all.things related to services and application are hosted..it.is called ecosystem


 Cross cutting concerns ..are things not related to business logic aop approach .. whenever requirement is not related to business logic then we use AOP APPROACH 


 Rc-tree...to.render 4 level.hieqrchaey in CIP 

Cip ..client to server ..we r making Ajax calls Ajax and restapi calls are almost similar 


Unix can't run bat file ..where Unix have .sh files Window tomcat ..bat file 

So we using tomcat Unix Whenever dom 

structure get changed it used to make changes with real Dom as well so updated part get rendered Props get updated via lifecycle methods

Props and states are interchangable 

We use state when data pass from top to bottom

We create wrapper class and pass this functionality. 


Jag ..java server faces allow web developers to build user interfaces for java server application

Jsf same  as gwt...question

Let say in our  application ..multiple objects are using at some other time ..in case of creating different tables ..we create table wrapper so everything  like formatting etc done at one file .

When state got changed ..redux got called then event will.be fired to check /fetch details from rest API server With response it will save data into.props 

React table ..is used to render on UI

Denounce input ..we use to render value at same time on UI

React ...API called as prime faces ..it contains all components ..it has all components


Flipkart lite..0.5 mb application

Flipkart main app ....35mb

One-way is everything is webservice ..we used to create top.level structure ..used to render microsite 

Webservice ..one service  is normal.and other  is microservice 

In bootstrap ..we used to make like similar way so webpage get rendered with same layout on desktop and other Mobile/tablet devices 

Landscape mode 

So we will create microsite ..kind of small.application ..APK file which will render only bootstrap URL...with every URL ..add new parameter to get response from server (which is expected at that point /URL)

IMP..POINT...
This keyword cannot be used with getstate and can be used with setstate only

With props ..this keyword is widely used 

Suppose there r 2 containers
React app
Simple container 

In one html,multiple container can be there (div)

But in react ..html can have only one container 

There can be n no of container ...but one react app will be there 

Containers r not linked with react app

React is UI library ..so how it takes data from server to local ..so component is needed call as redux 

It used to change state and  event fired..once state changed action get activated 
Here ..we are passing current to next state 
Next value get from when cirrent task is completed


Every state has action defined 


Saga is responsible for calling to.event


====================================================================================================================
react2
 
 React ..UI change 
Redux ..state change on base of action 
Redux saga ...saga recognize action based on event change
Response come on saga
State changed on redux 

Once state change then component get render on react 
React show up updated value 

Redux and thunk are almost same 

If class .. states and prop both availabl
If functionality component ..then we r not maintaing their states only we have props

Parent component..should maintain states of its child component 

Burger -app ...JSX is java script XML/html

Waterfall...we are making /customizing on UI side (CSS)

Table wrapper waterfall... Created for CSS purpose 

Input wrapper ..if input not valid ..then it will show error 

Component will recivie props...Get derived state from props


Error label visible only when there is error coming from parent 


Multipage form ..

These are badges ..on webpage ..we have pages ..1,2,3,4,5
In case of link ....We can navigate page1. To page4

But in badges we have to go in sequence only 


Numberinput wrapper..we r using stores to maintain states at single point 
Action has original state and next state 
Kind of number value validarion 

Request entity selector wrapper ..props must be controlled/managed by component owner 

Props can  write only at parent
=====================================================================================================
react 3
 
 Lodash ..java script library 

Owasp ..security standard


Table owner ..we cannot change row/cell prop values as its child only 

Request entity selector wrapper 

\b ... Zero 
/g  Global


CVE...it's standard of SCA
SCA standards ...CVE


OSWAP...STANDARD IS VERY GOOD  SO GENERALLY WE FOLLOW top 10


2 ways to render 

A)Intialize variable inside render method 

B)Put the condition into component and pass the property from parent


'Use strict' ..give error  else don't give error 

Searchable ...(typeable as well)
Searching ...changing state to new value 
.setstate()

Otherwise it shows null

Type and backspace delete 

Cosmetic changes ..UI arrow on top of drop-down 

Anchor ..like hand on link ..component that work as anchor like color shows R B G

We cannot pass function as argument in angular but it is possible in react 

State resetting is done via reload 
Timeout ..search request response 

Search ...put last search item into middleware (storage) or local whenever we click it will fetch all

Search data and put into search box ...it like Facebook search

Class component ..has both state and props

Functional component have only props So it.used as child as well as parent

Component will recivie props and children get rendered recursively


======================================================================
react 4
 
 Promise used to take resolve when AXIOS 
return  prime object ...using promise object we used to check state of object 

Prototype ..it's sort of blueprint 

For checking type of request object ..we are using... instance of 


Enumerable ..configurable. ...write ..kind of states 

Change in process ..every applicaiton has to procure tibco server 

Tomcat.  We have run/debug ..we can see status of applicaiton used in tomcat

Command design pattern
Tomcat tool ...Status ..run ..stop...if I click  on run inside tomcat ..it will start application to run so we are following pattern to start application via tomcat 
This is kind of command design pattern 

Command and executor patterns are  different

Executor will have action listener  command
Command will be there which invokes screen

Ways to change all classes 
Command design pattern ..one class to issue command and one class acting as executor 
3rd class ..invoker 


JavaScript...one applicaiton designed back 
type error but in latest version is removed 
All.of sudden it's stop working so whole IP

Class callcheck


Type checking ....check online

Binding method in JavaScript like bind(this).  Object 

Cip can be accessed from mobile also 

Stop propagation ..stop executing next methods

Touch keyword is used for.mobile /tablets...so that's why we can say cip can be access from.mobile as well

Prime faces ..overrides all UI components , everything created as UI component and max of them are stateless


Drop-down option ..it is used to be key and value pair 

Key ...used to go server for further processing

Option contain key and value 
Here value is label

Display of label as anchor tag (link)

JSON ...we are stringfying the value ...key value pair 

There is no overloading in JavaScript

Ecmascripts are browser supportable scripts 

Ecmascript is superset of JavaScript 
Like sometime browser is version 10 and website don't support browser version 10

Component will recivie props 
We use next props if there is change in prior and next props we used to reload
====================================================================================

react5
 
 JavaScript ..strong language handle many things at client side very effectively

We can make event handlers for.keys 


Date calender ...in java ...once u r selecting data ..need to fire event ..so that event was not there ..so due to which they changed their whole API 

Default implementation ...companies are providing open implementation which basically override default implementation 

Drop-down is like by default ...1value selector 
Later on ..2 value requirements etc


==================================================================================

collection framework /RMI/singelton
 
 Before java 1.1 we treat everything class and make object in form of key value to get map.behaviour 

Many problem occured lengthy code too large byte code array index bound exception etc 


Fail fast and fail safe iteration 
Fail fast will give exception

Fail safe - if I iterate any collection while integrate any collection it won't give exception 

Collection interface extends iterable 


Most of the application stop support system when upgrade is because libraries get new features and old get depreciated

We do depreciated to support backword. Compatibility

 We don't exclude  clases in library from any language 


For while for each are fail fast loopers


Basic iteratior in collection is fail safe 

Failsafe are used in multithreaded environment
Share market companies 

Changes going rapidly where map storing current values and if map don't get updated values 

Consider 2 options 
We updated map object and there code will fail because updation and retrieving at same time 

We don't update then u r old map.object 

Option option won't work

So in this case  we will use iterable as its failsafe  and we can perform updation and retrieving without any exception


Class implement interface 
Interface 1 extends interface 2 


Interface use when we have to deal with unrelated classes eg we use default implementation of connection objects 

Sample create connection ,subclass as query class ..we have to make connextio. Before query so we use multiple times and we don't create connection object everyone 
 

Browse means extends ,, add implements in eclipse 



Functional interface --- almost 1 abstract method 

Interface ___ any no of abstract method 

Marker interface --- or tagging interface ...it has no.methods ..tells to.jvm.about more info like bookmark etc 


Default capacity of arralist is 10
When it consumes 80% Araylist will grow automatically


Serializable , clonnabble is marker interface ,fail fast behaviour of iterator 


In case of index based operation ..go for arraylist

Vector is similar to arraylist , 

Specific implementation of iterator is list iterator 

Iterator is forward only but listiterator is forward as well  as backward 

Serial version UID is serial version identifier and it is used when doing serialization or deserialization where it checks type of object 


Convert Set to array == toArray()

List = new arraylist()

Hashset is an implementation of hashmap

The Spliterator interface, introduced in Java 8, can be used for traversing and partitioning sequences. It's a base utility for Streams, especially parallel ones


Load factor is used to be part of performance
 We used to calculate time complexity as we have lots of memory constraints

Headset navigable set

Internally tree set use navigable map


Hashset use hashmap


One JVM can run multiple application ---a 


How to create singleton object on multiple JVM ...only way out.is to.mark one singleton object ..if object is already present we have to stream it out 
Otherwise search for another instance  
Then it will pass request as stream 

Objects now all are running on JVM


We have commands in OS to check how many JVM running (jps from bin folder )



Serial version UID   

Class is serializable or not 

Parent and child relationship
Primitive objects are automatically serializable
Non primitive objects are those which we need to serialize 


Omit means exclude or leave out 



Serialized object ..if we take in local it will be in streams like for local we can use read and write objects 
Objects into stream where we have to use write objects 

But on transport layer we don't use read /write object ..there we use request and response objects 


Remote method invocation ... Client and remote server (we don't know where it's running )

After RMI ..soap get instroduxed 

Soap is platform independent wsdl code ..it can talk to any application ..XML java dotnet

But in case of RMI suppose one class which is available on remote machine ..and if I want to execute code on remote machine which is exposed publically so I can use RMI CALL only
If aware that Rpc cALL.IS EXPOSED 
Class name method name using these details ..I will.gwt details/output from that class via network so few feature make it more secure 
Calls get executed at remote JVM  in case of rmi

Skeleton is on server side and stub is at  client side 

Soap don't have things at server side like skeleton
Gwt is RMI calls


Soap -- jax-ws
Rest--- jax-rs

Soap calls get executed on tomcat/weblogic

Gwt/RMI.calls get executed on  remote jvm..there will be no server like tomcat/weblogic


Rmi is more secure ..in soap we can create stubs at client side 


Tomcat server in local ..per request consumes memory ..perdownload /per request. Which is load testing

Like 4gb server ..how many request we can handle ..on basis of that we configurr load testing


Hashmap 


Map usually Act as bucket of bins 

Multivaluemap spring ...

Hashmap collision...two objects having same hashcode but values different

====================================================================
executor framework 
 
 Earlier we used to creat threads via extending thread and runnable so
Difficult to manage native threads because memory consumption is high 


So executor framework used to create thread pool of particular size 

Cache thread pool ..which will have fixed no.of threads 
Short line threads ..used to fork if system has less thread then it will create new threads as per requirement
It will keep on creating new threads if process more threads

Context loader .  Listener ensires dispatcher servlet loaded properly or not 

Weadmin tool/CPS/cues ..it is responsible for adding/ deleting API users into.api

React JS works on top of npm
Intial state
Final state 

Component r getting divided into small components and that small component can be placed anywhere and call service

Everything made as dynamic and made modular 
I pass property and based on property ..things get rendered 

 I can mix react JS between html and JavaScript so putting dynamic code into html so kind of making html.dynamic 
So basically adding dynamic contents into.statix html.code 
Call one component under another comonen t 

Currently if I have to do operations on table ..then I will.iterate whole table in order to.get one id on.UI 

But in react JS ..when we clic on button we have designed in such a way then on click of button we get Id and then via service we can do.operation 

AXIOS API ..all rest calls via AXIOS API r easy

AXIOS is used for creating rest call..which call microservice and do backened update

Redux using AXIOS to syncup state change into frontend and backened 


Like JVM provides environment to java 
Similar way npm provides environment to react 

Npm start 
Npm install

Java mission control 
U can check beans created 
Events created /running 

General point 
Check maven dependencies
Check deployment assembly
Check other jars
Resource missing ...check in pom/application properties

(.) Means Unix current directory 

Instances of applicaiton context

Support guy ..if process exist ..process running else no exist means process not running 

Concept
When we join multiple tables in hibernate we use criteria ..we also use for single tables 

Enumeration ...list of names constants 

Cache URL ..public cache and private cache as well


Command design pattern ..it is used to decouple sender and receiver objects 

Blocking queues in multithreading



Protobuff ...it's Google library which is used to generate sort of buffer to BO (business object)
 Another definition of protocol buffer ...protocol to enable serialization and deserialization of structured data between different services
 
 
 ================================================================
 
 
 aaj
 
 tectia ..java api  

log file from remote swrver via java code and out into particular folder ..once it is located we will reqr that file and search required content 
instance of ..is comparison operator 

jsch ..user name pwd to get session
.ssh .
1st way  .we used to create session private key and public key
2nd way is to create session via user name pwd 


sftp progress monitor ..we can check to monitor file transfer progress
batch move...for downloading multiple files

download multiple files using ftp via java 
winscp is a windows based so we used batch

tectia is linux so we are going via java api


beans lifecyle ..we used to 

applocaiton context is more advanced vrsion of beanfactory 
all.beans get laoded into aplicaiton context ioc ar time of startup and where beans get seggragated as we have beans differentaion..like singleton ,,session ,protype


chaning concept ..one method get executed following other method execution etc 
1->2 soon 


when we parse values into java ..no case of value coneverted in java but in grails we have value contverted so it will update( : )everywhere

=======================================================================================================================

 tectia ..java api log file from remote swrver via java code and out into particular folder ..once it is located we will reqr that file and search required content
 instance of ..is comparison operator

 jsch ..user name pwd to get session 

.ssh . 1st way .we used to create session private key and public key 

2nd way is to create session via user name pwd

 sftp progress monitor ..we can check to monitor file transfer progress batch move...for downloading multiple files 
download multiple files using ftp via java 

winscp is a windows based so we used batch 
tectia is linux so we are going via java api 

beans lifecyle ..we used to applocaiton context is more advanced vrsion of beanfactory all.beans get laoded into aplicaiton context ioc ar time of startup and where beans get seggragated as we have beans differentaion..like singleton ,,session ,protype

 chaning concept ..one method get executed following other method execution etc 1->2 soon 
when we parse values into java ..no case of value coneverted in java but in grails we have value contverted so it will update( : )everywhere 

DdL ..data definition ...new colum. Addition Dml ...trigger insertion ..updation If we need source then give path of source folder or jar 


Remote service ..we cannot debug remote service also we r connecting through Hessian service 

Spring:boot:run Building project is always necessary when branch switch 

80% of energy should be consumed from solar panel 500-600 pretol pump Plastic waste ..give small balls Per ball 50-70 paise Gov planning to reduce consumption of diesel to its alternative to run trains Healthcare school colleges Temples 


Agileetholody Retrospect meeting at end of month Any sprint going on ..if spill.once happen then unable to complete task by deadline then it moves to next sprint Sprints work on stories

 U can take care of any story with higher points means story complex 

Kanban board ...Jira tracking system Intially we use few tables ..later stage we used to.shelf those tables ..

 Primary and foreign key constraint s so we need to insert constrains ..whenever any change in table then modified data get updated


 Incremental backup ...suppose we taken data from.prod last week it will create restore point next time we r going to take backup ..it will take data after restore point Modification +incremental 10+10gb It will touch only 20gb data and use same dump created last time


 Admin services ..persist operation Finder services ..get operation 


Who tells which jar is good or.not ..kind of UI Jndi we use where we have to manage datasource at server end Jndi..dB initialisation connection objects Before jndi we create connection objects ..query fire ..we used to get zero resultset given database are down so it will throw exception/error when query the database So solution ..when app start up then we connect to datasource ..drawback ..database connection is permanent so it is made as an overhead...so we make connection pool .. 


When app startup jndi.get intialized ..it is defined in web.xml ..we used to define jndi config on server side and jndi.name on applicaiton When applicaiton started it will lookup for jndi at server side As every server has one file ..general.concxept

 Then it will fire validation query ..once validation is successful then it is used to initialize jndi object ..that's why we check on logs 


Moqui framework ..more than 10,000 download of this framework 

PMC.managers are those who work on open source ..he knows in n out of the application 


Difference btw cache and dB count then we build cache again We fetch data from.cache region ...cachemanager is resultset Cache data region ...constraints condition created in java class...check in cache data source In distribution system we used to set configuration After that distribution and cache factory We get cache/gemfire object ..it is database connection objects


 Teller services ..front officer services Cues application specific Database ..query are there 2 datasource ...cachedatasourceproxy dbdatasource ..dbdatadourceproxy cachedatasources Dispatcher is intialized by spring servlet container ..inside that context ..big bowl ..all beans get initialized Pointcuts in logs 

.we can see 

Request decompression. (RD) RESPONE COMPRESSION(RC) 

UNTIL autowiring is not completed properly ..then we will not be able to use parent autowired object Class a is depending on class B Spring will.not intialize class A ..it is done via autoproxy 

At time of request decompressing objects and at time of response ..compressing objects so it consumes less bandwidth Compression and decompression ..we have to apply keys to get real objects 


======================================================================================================================================


aaj2
 
 Bare soap services ..are those where we don't follow any standard ..cxf include stub skeleton ..if we use soap service with application then we use length wise response and request will be defined 

Fork ..when 1 txn is dependent on other like credit and debit

2 threads initiate at same time 
If anything fails..then debit thread is being forked with credit thread 


Document should be clear crystal

Ping directory .. identity management 
Session data 
If we put 1lac users in session it will take around 2kb per user so total memory used ..2byte *1lac so it's big hit memory which makes memory down 

Ram memory should be used by system not data so for that reason we use ping directory 

Vue technology 
Mostaches

Mail template
JSON ..Jackson tree model
Object to object then at last breaks into key,value pair 
 
JSON maps into values ..there r 2 ways 
Automatic ..spring used to take care 
Manual ..JSON mapper while setting up data ..we used to parse object mapper

Product owner ..used to tell automation will reduce operating cost or.not ..sit with technical team ...like there is much main efforts 
Backfill..existing resource called benchmark

Technical architect ..which will decide this much human resource needed 

Kick off meeting in agile ..

Fixed budget projects ..contract projects ..this much changes yearly 

Variable budget project ..any erro comes we have to fix 

Aem tool..easy to.learn ..niche technology
Sap hybris ..e-commerce platform technology 
70. 80% of companies use sap hybris ..it's an e-commerce technology 

Blob store ..binary log takes more spaces as compare to integer 

Images ..100kb binary data going to store in dB 300k-400k equavlient to 150k record in table
That's is why we don't prefer blob data into dB 

Pdf is getting stored in bytes as we are not reading not doing any manipulation

Eovs ..end of vendor support

If application process writing something 
Did ,logs etc require enough space that we move to.NAS

MESH ROUTER ..which is used to create connectivity all over hours 

Message object ..we will get text object out of it 
Text object will contains XML in string format

No.implementation ..so.aspext using 


Parent of  every call.is Ajax only 

In cup world .we r getting data from CPS via elastic indexes

SOlr ...it is sort of server which maintains dictionary eg .. newspaper ..let say I have to.search (name xyz) in all.newspaper of last 4 years ..so it will run algorithm ..midn of crawling will be there ..content used to crawl
Index ..subindexes ..sort of manual crawling 

Licence and solr ..same thing

Hashcode and equals  

======================================================================================================================


aaj3
 
 Comxept.of hashcode
Ifequal ..nothing to.update 
Hashcollsion ..then we do bucket 1->box2->box3_>

Contract between hashcode and equals ..if two objects are equal then must have same hashcode ..but if 2 objects have same hashcode then may or may not be equal
 That's the reason we implement both 
U must override hashcode in every class
Then override equals()

But, it is not necessary that the hashCode() method will return the distinct result for the objects that are not equal (according to equals() method).

Hashcode returns integer value generated by having algorithm
 purpose of hashcode is to provide numeric representation of an object

Different objects of same class will work without hashcode 

Shallow equal..checking reference of objects 

Deep comparison..we used to compare values of object

U r bugging me like anything 
I cannot work in micromanagement 

In react ..when dom structure change then only that part of dom change not whole 

Complex algorithm running in background which will get captured 

Anywhere if we have bulky data either cache/ram ..we can create indexes


Hashmap can maintain million of record ..it is using inbuilt indexes

Any technology internally it is maintaing indexes

In java application like txn applicaiton end of month having high load 

So only for one day we maintain server for load ...only solution is we create dynamic server 

Dynamic memory allocation...we used to run VM SERVICE which check load on server 

Print service ..which takes data fill-up data into templates and send that to print server 

One user recivie daily statement a d all of sudden user requested statement of January ...that services used to create indexes
Everytime it cannot go to.server (document server central)


Finale designed by Infosys 

Checked ..compile exeption
Unchecked ...runtime exception..class ..file not found ..numberformat ..SQL..connection
Why we extend runtime exception because we want to.handle runtime exception

E-commerce want to start ..if employee size less open source then use PHP technology
=========================================================================================

aaj4 
 
 Cygwin ..provides interface 

rpm cannot install on windows


Stress testing ..we usually put load on server 

Rpm is exectutable but run only in Linux not in windows ..we can get are in windows but run 



, just because JSON is currently the most talked about due to its association with JavaScript and extensive support across different languages and platforms, you shouldn’t completely disregard XML. 

Monolithic app ..we used to maintain states at server side 

TCP ..stateful protocol
Http protocol ..don't have its own state ..it's stateless protocol ..it's 1 trip session which is request and comeback as response 

But in realtime we have multi request and multi response ..we used to maintain token based authentication system 


How locker used to work 
It will check key authentication
Banker will ask locker no 
One key with Banker 
One key with consumer 
Both keys applied on locker
Banker is authentication server ..it will check in header  token key ..it will redirect further 

JSON will travel through network
Which is basically key value pair 
Process JSON and return JSON serriable object 

Lamda expression ___.   ::
We r getting data from AMC

@QUALIFIER ..suppose ther are multiple instances ...it is used to pass if different services and interface implementation

To facilitate your timeline .we have done changes 


Webservices have multiple versions ...v01. V02 etc and all.jars are available in artifactory


..txt file cannot converted to.pdf because pdf structure is little different 
Way we used to create pdf is different 

CSV is comma separated file 

Pdf to txt not possible 

Endpoint deployed to server but client don't have visiblity

Some.companies used to maintain endpoint version we used to share client version like www.citi.com/v1
www.citi.com/V2


Generally different implementation of interface 

Autowire the interface not class

ABC handlers.


Producer and consumers ..we won't have producer details we will have topic info.details 
We are connecting to consumer topic
Topic design happen at JMS server

Want space in JMs via topics

Recursive call ..same method calling again 

Lazy loading at database side ..via hibernate only


Services have been stopped gracefully
=======================================

aaj5
 
 Flask ..microservice architecture framework used to create sort of rest api like in spring tomcat is integrated Same in flask we get environment and development in python 

Requirement.txt is pom.xml manage.py is like properties config file at java side 

Pip in python is like maven in spring /java 

Every module have its own init file
 Any python file can have any no.of classes Jacvaatacktrace ..fully thing we get We used to.define route for API calls But in python we don't get whole stack trace Blue print Concept ..our application object is created from object of application context Same way we can hacve object of applicaiton using blueprint 

Decator is similar to annotation in spring At evwrylevel we have interfaces in java Similarly we use flask here Pycharm ..ide ..python 370 installer like jdk

 I am flooded with API request ..via flask 

we can stop this When we. Say service is loaded now ..??...any service will have load on startup ..server start and request accept/serving is different ..some services got executed on 1st call Server/service can be assumed as started 

when it will start accepting request Hibernate queries..mapped URL path is part of spring intialization When we store values in sp or update in sp ..sequence is maintained in sp 

Thumb rule ..any error in logs ..check depencies /jar missing in claspath ..find location of jar via Google and out into.clasapath 2 servers comes when download a) Yes or no ..attachment B) inline... tellings to.browser 

Everyfile we get data in form.of row like checkbox, textbox so iterating one cell..one row Eclipse logs also ..there used to create lock file .lock file..must delete if eclipse hanging


 Retention policy ..at which point we define annotations to be discarded 

Favison.ico..image of Citi in cps projects Txns logs get maintained ..backup so it's easy to Incase of rollback 

Qtp482729929...kidn of thread 
no 

<Target>  X <target>
x  above ..It means they r expecting java version of 1.8 in source and target Aux ..auxillary ..in react /java we cannot return 2 values so what we do wrap into objexts ..class ...auxillary Dom ..on.top we have html head body ..suppose want to return head and body both ..so for this purpose we wrap on top level.hiearchary 

In react ..sometime we return multiple tag need to be returned so key word is HOC /HIGH LEVEL direct 

dependency ..in pom.xml 

Indirect dependency .. dependency in other components

==========================================================================================================

 2 ways ..sending email with attachment

Sending email  and attachment inline but java don't support 2nd option

Email sent ..URL +one id

URL opening ..one image 

It will.hit server when image get rendered ..so it will hit the service /server 

AI service ..every company publish quarterly /annually report 
Format is different of every company 

When we are creating new file .it.will replace existing file 

2 files with same name is not allowed in.explorer

It will.be good to have bit hike  
primary concern is to be in US ..VISA 

Soft delete ..disable 
Hard delete..deleting row


All files in maven-repo ..all jars get updated and create hash 

In almost in 1 yr I am  comfortable in cps/cues 
I am.capable of handling issues  with help.of team

Multiple things to.learn ..as I never worked in get but it was a great exposure
When I joined many things were going on ..it was great 

If there is an area of.improvement then pls.let me know 
As time is passing I want to stabilze somewhere so I am thinking to stwbilize myself in Citi ..I am.not.feeling stable anywhere 

It was first time when I went through 2 migration in my 6 year career  
Specially 

After 5 years ..I should be able to handle more projects ,new ideas ..till 1year it was kind of learning phase 

I.will.be in good position to handle projects independently

I.should be able to offload some work from.china side 
We have very.high dependices on China side so there will be less lag

Build project ..nesting problem...buildpath ..linksource ...add src/main of project 

When CFO request session is created ...
Let say Session time ...30 minutes .. at 29th minute session will be renewed for another 31 minutes 
Token validity is expired ..we r trying to forge token 

What is the appraise cycle..rates can be revised or not 



Context path ..part of root folder

For every connection ..we can create txn manager 

Local txn ..user intiated txn are local like sign-up ..save ..persist

Global txn ..executed at application level

Both server r different 
Webpack server ..ui ..react
Tomcat ..backend 
So  need to go for different deployment 

CIO ..first build cipui after that it create backend build then copy directory of minfied version of JS folder into backend code of cip


React has dom  structure and it's just library not following MVC architecture

Let is advanced version of var

Ecma6script ..ecma -62

Ecma is standard for scripting language like JavaScript ..JScript

Mostly war get picked from target 
War is deployed in Linux

Not all classes from target not get picked 

Bearer token ..after login ..for further request we have bearer token 


Monolithic..session maintain at server side 

Microservice ..token based is ther which is part of header 

Default behaviour of CPS

Cgmi ...on
Cgml...off

If user not exist in CV then create as group user 

Cgml ...require settlement instructions 

CPS report all queries generate dynamically

Reflection ...creating /cloning object at other side so we can't copy from client to server .. modifying behaviour of class 


Client run on JavaScript ..properties we can't take on client side

 Bitcoin runs on Blockchain technology 
Raspverri pie gets heated up as it's microcontroller 

Overlooking ..concept where we can utilize our system till 90 to 90% 
We cannot use 100% capacity of system 
Until.there is zero gravity concept



If zero gravity ..no.energy loss we can use that energy 

We used to keep server inside oceans 

Microsoft already implemented ...no water leakage 

Eg ..take fossil water proof watch 

Sugar mill ..it goes through whole process ..sugarcane jaggery 

Residue left ..used to.make.sugar 

Energy generated during burning of residue ..water generate steam

Server should be kept in minimal temperature 

Microft Facebook Cisco server have low energy cost 

1 laptop take 40-50 wattpower

Is any heavy program
CPU usage high ...multiple thread 
Thread 1 ...data taking from.harddisk
Thread 2 ...sequential data 
Bit and  bytes 


MP3 ..sequence of bytes 
Stream ..keep on reading ..thread1  running internally
MP3 application..one thread running by consumer 
Thread 3 ..taking data from datasource


Raid disk .. these r on demand hard disk
Which requires no change to existing 

Server ..2 types 

Application server  like CPS /cues 
Data server ..like log server ..storing data into hard disk 
1 server having 1tb hard disk space 
Swap space 

Every applicaiton create so.mnay logs so there is shortage of space in directory 
So.we can  raid hardisk to existing one
 On running system 
Means we don't need to stop/Make application down  in order to.make this hardware change
=========================================================================================================

 -e package rpm

On Goals of pom.xml

Memsql ...load data into memory


Filwatcher concept....ready/ack/bkp 
Fail succrs

Npm webpack
Npm install webpack
Npm webpack build
Webpack config.js ...make it false 
Index.js is starting point in react 


Truststore ..it is the keystore that contains public key certificate of external host you trust


Cxf ..check online 

Apache grovvy ..it's dynamic language ...but at maximum places we use it as scripting language 

Grovvy can be used as programming as well as scripting language 

Grails ..validation is also easy
In cip world..we r using it as validator 

System is in prod and after time we come to.know one more validation needs to be added until I restart server I cannot add in applicaiton context 

So they added scheduling 
@rnablescheduling 

One change is done and scheduler is complete scheduler will load XML again so changes will be reflected

Grovvy is scriping language so need to compile again 
Grovvy ..dynamic loading XML
So scripting folder get uploaded into server ..it get compiled automatically

Java ..need to compile/build again for any new change 
Grovvy ..directly we can use grovvy file ..so compiling and running at runtime

Pfcpsa1u...It is not restricted location like flat file

Fork ..a thread is running and want to attach another thread and check one thread task is completed..sort of synchronization call
We will fork existing running thread and other thread execute 
Create thread pool...size of 4 ..once all threads get consumed then it will create 10 threads from fork join factory 


Static bean ..we defined in XML @ bean 
Component scan package it scan all packages but sometime we don't want to scan all so use dynamic bean 

Dynamic beans 

Dynamic bean ..at time of server intialization ..it gives error ..if any property miss 

Struts ..how exactly it used to work 
Strut is a Framework developed in MVC architecture


Composite primary key is not supported by JPA

JPARepository<t,d> ..bare methods
Hashmap ..1key value pair

F12 ..200k under network 
Huge web traffic is there from single IP
They used to block IP by applying filters

Requesting 


Grand authority concept ....roles and authorisation 

Principal objects in cues ..it is an object of grand authority  

Filter chain ...when we used to filter
One after another ..filter chaining concept 

JSON ...key value pair
Bison ..key,value, type ...used for mongodb 


How we r handling exception in spring boot applicaiton
we r using exception handlers
@exceptionhandler

For every controller layer ..we used to have passing value from controller to service layer ..instead of passing directly we use adaptor


Instead of putting 2000lines of code into service layer ..create intermediate adaptor ..and  put code into it 

Dozer mapper ...copy data from object to another object recursively ...I want to copy content from server to local so dozer mapper comes to picture 
Like ..suppose 50 line of code ..we will not copy 50 files from server to local ..instead we will create interfaces to hold properties ..so  we  can pass value from service to target 

.P12 ...domain specific certificates



Ctrl+home...top

====================================================================================

modern deployment 
 
 MODERN deployment 

Production deployment ...

Once tested in uat..we use that uat tested deploy in production

New story ...
Generally VM and instances run ..buildnumber ..and we go to deployment via shell script 

But.now instead of deploying different version we deploy 

We will use same uat and build in different machines (IP change movement)...whole machine is moving so no environment issues
Hardware and software firewall will.keep it as 

VM sort of machine ..once they move to.particular env ...VM are self start themselves 

If any issue comes in one env ..u will drop the instance ..earlier we use OS memory wastage ..system-vdi-os-deployment ...4 layer of memory consumption 

Vdi concept is almost removed 
Small application 
Cisco ..we r using 

Bitlocker __ security ..until we r providing security data is secure 

Nowaday Once u start cisco application it will be blankmachine ...via internet we get Virtual OS ..virtual software 


When I work with preprod /uat  family..we can disclose things internally 

I want to maintain secrey (client facing application) when it comes to PROD
It should be password protected 


Prod deployment ...we have separate room ..war room ..But nowadays they give blank machines which invokes modern deployment invention


==============================================================================

microservice patterns
 
 Decompose DS
Strangler D's
Saga DS

Saga pattern ..breakdown txn into multiple steps ..if any car txn failure used to trigger failure txn 
If it's success move to second step
Cammunda is a tool which used to design the workflow

It will make graphical modeling ..it maintain data consistency

Saga DS is used to implement txn that spans  multiple services
Each service in saga performes its own txn and publish an event other listen to event and perform next local txn 

CPS cues use event based system no workflow
H2 database is in-- memory database in java 
Saga keywords used to define action /steps ..saga break into activites

Cammunda ..workflow system what should next step/action
Springboot has by default hikari datasource 

When heavy data and bulky process we don't for BPM cammunda

For realtime scenarios we use JMS queues kafka

Txn based system where anywhere fail..we generally use Saga

Trip booking system ...saga

Decompose dp..by business domain

Order service payment service ..shopping service

Strangler design patter. ..some part will be monolithic
Montholitic ..single container we deploy whole application ..disadvantage ...one thing down everything down..no multithready coding as server is used to handle multithreading functionality

Server runs in env called ecospace

When environment then all intermediate services will be down ..cob will.handle this thing and intermediate service won't get down



Service A connecting to service B via TCP.layer ..requirement for updating firewall.. services will be down an email notification sent to consumers 

Prod server traffic is going via LB
One instance of prod down ..another instance of cob will.pick it  devops script are there


Blmpn
XML r user-defined before generating we should define rules ..client and server will replace the xsd then only we can validate the data 

Kubernetes ...automate deployment ..scaling operations of container based application across cluster of nodes 

Kafka way of  message dealing is different as comapre to.jms queues 

Cammunda ..for everyflow there is a boundary of events


Vkey is securest way of creating token in world 

IAM..IDM
FORGET ROCK CYBERARK


Spring cloud Netflix 

Discovery server ...100 ..99 actual  +1 itself discovery 

7 services running on discovery server ..internally 6 service and 1 is Eureka service .
Eureka server cannot discover itself so discovery server will be used to register with 6 services

Discovery server is part of.netflix


Spring cloud data flow ..an integration API to integrate API with client application seamlessly like the way PayPal.used
Broker sometime a intermediate service ..we don't want to.disturb client ..


==========================================================================

notes
 
 Query parameters 
query parameters are used to sort/filter resources. On the other hand, path parameters are used to identify a specific resource or resources. You can't omit values in path parameters since they are part of the URL.

Query parameters .can.  see in URL 
Path parameter can't see in url

Beaded token on service access ..type of authentication
Header ..channel ID content type

Swagger is API for easy  documentation used to provide by BA

Curl for making http request without a web browser
cURL is basically used to transfer data using Internet Protocols for the given URL.

Curl is a Client side program. In the name cURL, c stands for Client and URL indicates curl works with URL’s.

The curl project has a curl command line and also a libcurl library. In this article we will be focussing on the curl command line


Reinvention of Ajax calls

Html page ..we use java code to.make calls on server ..instead of refreshing whole component 

Request response objects which is basically part of server side 
Parsing request and response getting whole content like html CSS image ,html content get rendered  ..post this Ajax came into.picture  where we used to send part of data to server in which we have info and we are looking refresh /modification 
Server used to send response instead of sending whole content we only send particular thing which we need at that ment

Then rest came into.picture 

4 type of request ..post delete get put

Same CDN concept ..html images data coming from CDN ..here Ajax will.dexide which content to deliver further from server 



Xeon machine ...

JavaScript ..runs on client side using client resources to get data from server 

Android phone ..Flipkart 
Amazon applicaiton ...some.content is already downloaded from playstore now Amazon sever only sending offer price etc which is very small content into.encrupted content and our mobile is using and decrypting that content and rendering on ur screen
Amazon using ur mobile resources to optimize it's performance 


In playstore many applicatio are following below behaviour
Designed sever side application and used java script 
Render at client and get executed at client side ..all objects everything created at client side so object GC is used very less JVm and momery  usage is less 

To design an application ..person in backend only knows angular ..

One guy knows angular and one guy knows backend 

UI design htm pages and want data on html age ..don't know. Where backend developer sitting and doi g deployment /development 
Backend developer design document and send request/response object to.ui developer 

Client requirement ..we want to see Ui component first ...once apporval given then proceed as timeline are tight 


One team ..all UI related they used to.mockup with backend team 

Mockup ..login page  contain submit txt button ..given to developer to render on homepage ..username and PWD from UI ..once login is successful he will send validarion..he designed backend part 

Client has given 1 week.time and user will show login credtional page submitted 
Backed. ..user is validated 
Mockup shared with client and backend developer 
Backend developer ..restful services  generating on basis of login creditionals

Client approval ..login should start worki g 

Resource utilisation 

UI component . Buttons added ..controller then Dao...UI.is free then backend is busy and vervwrsa 
Effective way is...rest service design in backend side and used on UI side 


Resource utilisation ..server side people management ..UI design ..2 people are working at same time 
Disadvantage..performance can't be measured ..don't know who has created the problem on UI ..data is not coming 

Security concerns..we r storing data on client ..and client is always considered as non-trustable 

Document.ready(function)
Script will.be enabled once page rendered completely

No error.in rendering of page ..JavaScript code not shows so JavaScript code is not executed for security purpose 

Advantage of JavaScript ....all events and component will.not be executed if page is not rendered 

If any error in development it will be corrected before delivery to client 

Restfull cal to system whether user is existing or.not it will.give success response else throw error 

Restful service is used to.manage its own database

Jersey .. framework used to design restful API

Dropwizard ..framework to design rest API


Sometime we use ..yml files ...it used to.maimtain parent child relationship ..define parent propery of dB ..it will add configuration into data source object 

But in applicaiton properties we have key pair form not parent child thing 

@valid ..@notnull

Developer ..junit 
Integration and regression testing

Apache jmeter .. regression testing 

Selenium jmeter..automated testing 
For web applications
Before /after test cases are there 
Testiing /mocking concept 
We cannot call directly that service so we create. Mock object of that service 
Controller Dao layer testcases will be different

Injecting mocks ..for which service/class we are injecting mocks 
Asset ..is used to check with condition
Assertrow
Assertcall
 
We will always avoid calling real objects as it's not right so we will.make mock.objects


Project facets to used for.importing projects from one ide to another Ide


Junit Vs mock 
Junit ..lots of code is there ..both 
Mockito ..we added methods , annotations to minimize the code
Mocking reason ..we have several dependcies across the project so to.keep env isolated we have to mock the behaviour of the dependencies 


MVC .

Model ..business +persistence layer
View ....presenter 
Controller ..handle request and response objects 

Wsdl ..web service description language 
Calling service /code ..info needed ...methods u using ..IP address

Wsdl design in XML.files 

Nobody can consume webservice until description is provided 
So we r using swagger in case of rest 
Soap ...wsdl

Steps to work with swagger 

Spring fox ..swagger 2 dependency add in pom.xml


In spring all objects are managed by spring container 

Why cant we run services on local  because of connection issue   that is why we use swagger as service is deployed somewhere else 

Swagger a communication channel between consumer and producer


Hal browser ...add dependency in pom.xml..it will redirect to hal browser 
Additionally you can see all internal beans information ..beans created in hal browser 
In simple words monitoring applicaiton via hal.browser

Filtering concept ..let say I have 10 field in pojo class file  and I don't want to send Ssn/dob etc in other word not to send entire response back to client 
So use filtering concept 
Static filtering and dynamic filtering 
So @jsonaignore 

Inmemory authentication or dB authentication


Composite class ..it's is base class belongs to Google 





IT rule ..if u want to use resources from mobile ..then take permission

====================================================================================
Eureka server/ hystrix 
 
 It is known as discovery server ..it uses heart beat concept 
It is used to register with self
It is used to register with microservice


Hystrix is a library  ..it handles fallback easily ..a circuit breaker 

Downstream cal CPS API due to high load  cps API takes time and hystrix won't mark API down and they will do custom reply like resource busy 
API busy so basically fallback handling easily 



Turbine is also tool which integrate multiple streams and give one  single stream 

It takes data from hystrix Eureka and give a single stream 



Zuul is an edge service basically if I want to.hide my URL and showcase something else then we will use zuul

Handle response properly for outside team but will.give error in case of internal API hit 


Zuul is an edge service that proxies requests to multiple backing services. It provides a unified “front door” to your system, which allows a browser, mobile app, or other user interface to consume services from multiple hosts without managing cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and authentication for each one.

==============================================================

Monday notes on
 
 Error we had during safrword 

Change it to new object and get rid of error 

Overall 2 request fire 

In single request ...we should complete whole thing 

Past....One single  request object firing 
But now our requirement scenario will.not come 

Framework level changes will be required .....CPS 

The way data we r rendering data is different between CPS and cues 

Provider key 

Everything taking into.provider key 
How exactly provider key working 
How they r processing data into datgrid 


Object get passed in provider key 
Provider key has its own implementation
One where passing whole.object 
Other where passing key value pair drop down thing 



Swift is an iOS language

We can design IOS based application via swift 
How data is getting filled into datgrid 

Flexdatagrid 

Keyprovider ..it's gives/store/keep unique records only ..differe t than Apache poi excel


Local.repo ..intermediate list of objects ..database taken ...filteration/alteration done at local.respository 
Activity handler ....

At time of rendering how we will call.init method 

Pager implementation ..server side pagination

Grid working on I'd concept 

Look and feel difference

Ps -ef 

Tomcat ..admin console where we can deploy application 

WC ..word count


Post construct concept is At time all objects r loaded into spring container


We have stereotypes to define type of class's
After object get created for particular class ...tagged@ post construct

@predestory ...before removing object ifwe have to do manipulation


Is it a good benchmark 

Thread pool size = 200
It is possible that some tomcat internal threads are included in this and we will see other tomcat mechanism 

Citi is big bank will.comeup with big big suggestions ...end of the day ..we have to support the system 
Mim is nightmare managed by Citi acting like auditor 


You r not happy with system ..move out of the system 

Seeders ...sort of catalyst

Deploy thing in PCF

We cannot access LDAP system from local

Shared resource concept ... two application cannot use same resource at a time Like camera 

I know you r lying we can just conclude the interview 

Client ...f12 network mode 


Gwt flow life cycle

While rendering loading grid data 


One man army 

Current ..when page render ..we call.grid to be loaded but now btw grid called and nothing happens 
Temp.solution ...once page rendered completely then we load grid

React is built on web component 
Webcomponent is core of html 

React support webcomponent 

Arithmetic error ...int To Tiny INT 
WHICH IS not possible it will loose some value 

Divide by zero is also arithmetic exception 

How liststore works in gxt
Liststore provide data to grid 


lOP..loss of pay

View created then calling to presenter to render value at that html we are setting values

Instead of calling presenter ..calling view first 
Store got intialized

View = list = zero 
Store intialized with zero because we are calling view first 


We set MFA list /grid at presenter layer 

List = arraylist 
How to update post rendering 

Replace all with local.history 

When page got rendered it should get intialized 

When page rendered make event handler ..event. Takes updated data 

When rendered with system size then list size print 

We will render first and then Intialize and call event as well 

Blank set (empty)
Later on will make changes 

Listed means market reputation ..no of employees 
Model key ..one key used to generate we r overriding functionality


How they r refreshing ..add selection handler 

Relative height ..datgrid is in control.panel 

Overflow ...div concept 

View component ..100 records 
One way ....Scroll.bar visible
Other way 

Pdf fit into screen size 
Scrol bar works on relative height concept 

Container works on relative height width concept 

Empty div concept ...div is imaginary concept 

We can put submit button to reduce code 

At 3rd character and 4 th character ..2 queries joining ...ideally.not correct so.delay of 3 seconds 

We will design as part of framework custom implementation

Etc folder is on class path when build it takes from class path 

Client factory ...very important concept ..we need to Intialize client object for any UI operation 

Prepared statement alternative to jdbc template  maintained by spring 

Minor and major java version 

Bug fixes ..minor release 

Major ...pkg changes ..top features

Cues version ..1.01 release ..old release. .1.0 so it contains minor versions 


Empty div has no height 

Query columns ...???  

Means setstring (1,safeword)
Setstring(2,safeowrdatatus)

First column ..first ?
2nd column ...second ?


Web3.0

Breakthrough 
Setting up components across world 

Semantic web is making internet simple 
So common.person use internet components use it properly

Max people don't understand how to.do.web hosting ..sor sort of simplification will.be included

Jndi configuration. 


Client side pagination ..less data 
Server side pagination ..more data

If more data go for server side pagination 

Reason 

10000 records ..it will.get first 100 pages from server so.no.performance issue from UI perspective

But at client side . pagination ..we will get whole chunk of data at time of rendering so performance will be impacted 

Client side pagination is like scrollable 

Tooltip.making collapsible 

Gali cricket ..AI applicaiton 
Stadium 4 people can Play ..live commentary

Paging bar internally loading 
Xbox layout 

Clustered index ..defines the order in which physical data is stored in table 
One cluster index per table 

Primary key constraint create clustered index automatically on that column 

Non clustered index slower than clustered 

Folder ..read /write permission 


??? Means don't exist in source  code after pull

Money centric compamy 
Not like customer centric company 
Pagination intialization at different layers 

Project visiblity based on criticality and funding 

Request got raised goes for budget apporval

Highest tenure ..means highest time period 

Editable ..copy grid data 
 

=====================================================================================================================

Wednesday notes
 
 Search component.js


Reactdevtools/profiler/debugger 
All work as anaylzer
Which will segregate the category of error ..like window error or application error ...basically give proper details of error


 ....basically any navigation 
Error we r facing 

Global installation

GitHub access


Profileguijs

Searchcontainer ...like 


Webpack.Config.js ...autogenerated file 

Index.html

Backend call
Client relationship call
User id based on crid
Resource call 
Accounts entitlement call


Hooks and service integration

Preuninstall ...only keep backup war 


Preuninstall  the whole system war and then postinstall




Cip world

You should maintain soft heart at my side as well

-e jar

-e -X compile


Download is read access if download at my machine from GitHub/server 

Upload is write access if upload to GitHub server ...write only acess

If pushing something on other env...there can be issue 

If it had at local then it was my fault


Eclipse can covneted to sts via sts plugin 

Just offline download and install in eclipse

Clean workspace in eclipse ...under project ...use when one time it works and other time don't works 
Restart build restart

@pwrsistencecontext ...same like user context we maintain at database side


Vanilla JavaScript .. is plain javascript.

New container of every page


Weak copy.concept ...(shallow copy concepts are same)
Whenever Mocking requirement is there
 
Reflection..

When to save Profile ..we make profile proxy object ...we get value from textbox 
So here I don't want proxy object because 
I just want empty object

What is the problem he is saying ...he is giving false information


=================================================================


new saturday
 
 Jsp advantages ...it is most of container supported hot deployment ..make required changes in jsp and replace old page with updated jsp directories so container will load new jsp 


Jsp life cycle ... Translation compilation class loading inttalixatuon request processing ,destroy

 Jsp init and js destroy methods Can be overident using jsp declaration scripting element 

Put Everything in web inf to prevent direct access of jsp page

 Jstl advantages...faster development ...many tags it provide simplify the jsp Code resuablility No need to.use scriplet tag

 Servlet config ....web container creates object of servlet config for each servlet It is used to.pass configuration information to.servlet Responsible for initializating this object
 Use getservletconfig() to get object for servlet


 Servlet context ..web container create object of servlet context for each web application Provide access to web application parameters to servlet It basically give getservletcontext() 



Task of servlet container ...communication support ..lifecycle and resource management ....multithreading support and jsp.support

We can use servlet context object ...and define parameter s..in web.xml

 Web server ..handle http request ..understand http.language and run on http.protocol Handle http request from client browser and respond with html response 




 Using Application server ..additional feature such as enterprise java bean support ...Jms messaging support ...txn management ....it is a webserver with additional functionality to web developers with enterprise application



 Web-app ....are modules that run on server to provide both static and dynamic content to client browser 


Servlet and cgi comparison ... Servlet r robust ..no memory leaks ,gc...web application developed with server CA. Run on any standard we container such is tomcat

Better performance then CGI(common.gateway interfaces )

Url encoding ...it is process of converting data into cgi form

All logs get stored in Nas server 
Virtual path ..it exist but we don't get access until we have home folder access 
It runs on SSD which makes it very fast 
To avoid latency btw applications  
Logs r continuously running and application won't become slow so no.network.latency 



Top.command ...used to check.usage in Linux 

2 issues ..logs r not.getting created 


External user for server ..

Over the putty.  We r logging into system ..put creditionals 

There is specific user ...not exposed to putty but it is inside the system.

Oltp processing is similar to batch 
Take 1000 record data from tables and put into.memory or virtual table 

Once it's processed it remove data from temp tables 
 Benefit of this table ..oltp.has put 99 records and oltp server failed at last record ..so.oltp.can capture in tables (99 already  and it.is failed at last record 


I want to move out of organization due to.personal.things and I need your references ...it.will.be great for positive reference 


Oltp dao ..which r going to.update CPS related tables 

Replication process ...suppose 2 services ...both service updating single database 

For these sort of thing we used to maintain cache /intermediate 
Ah and cps cache db 



We only maintain cache at CPS side like cpscacheswrver ...there is no word like ahcache at our side 

Suppose we r entering data in pfsubaccnt there will be linked enteries in other tables  as. Well

Listener r configured in such a way ..once finalized it will update other related tables 

Generally we do partitining  in audit tables year wise

Replication policies ..it get replicated over all instances 

One to one ...


There is a difference btw  instances and server 
One server can run multiple.instances one different port  ..

40404 ..cpscache 
40405...ahcache


Listener are in ahcmdsrv which r listening all.backend server (front agent ) Operation through ahservices


Weak copy concept
Ahversion support util ...weakcopy.java
..it creating weak copy 

Weak copy ..it used to make weak copy of class 

Source and target defined 

Target in which we used to convert 
Source ..object returning after comparing source and target classes
I

It will create difference total methods 

Weak copy class 
Ahversion support util ..vsu.java 

PFID..it work.in window session 
But PFID won't work in Linux session. 

At convention is PFID ...camel case convention

every service used to maintain some.kind of versioning ...general concept 



Incase of durable connection ...if txn management so we need durable 

Non durable ..user going to particular screen and idle for couple.of.hours then we don't need to.maintain session 


Every developer ...expects 3-5% of error 

10 user stories ..1,2 defects r permissible 
99% code should be good 

Tdd ...first test cases r designed then development get started 

How view should be installed /executed ?


2 types of connection 

Durable and non durable

What is debugging ..internally reading and connecting to server 


Atlas mongodb

Create cluster ..created uswe

Whitelist ip address 





Java run on byte code 


Inside eclipse 

When compile the class ..when run ...2 links /index created 
One is class to.java and other is java to class 

Cross references r created


Mongodb ...bson is popular in JavaScript community 

Meanstack react ...very stable built in application
Meanstack angular.   

Scale horizontally ..which means u can add cheap.machines to build up clusters


React concepts 

2 types of hooking 

Router ..used to take care of navigation 

Props...child to parent ..when we pass value from child to.parent 

Whenever changing /moving from parent to child ..then we use states 

React js life cycle 
4 things 

Intialization...setting up proprs and states 

Mounting ..rendering components 
Any validation before rendering then use 
(Component will mount )method

Once rendered ..component didmount method get called 

Should component update....suppose data is rendered 

Before changing component...table rows it will call (should component update)
Component will update
Render 
Componentdidupdate


Unmounting is like u can clear sessions ..clear data source etc

Redux and reflux components...going to change state


For maintains state ..we use action 

Niche technology ..are very hard to find ...engineer are rarely available

Action r stateless component 

Axios ..rest API call
Xhr ..ajax call ...support asynchronous call

Java ...server side language 

Xhr call ...client side to server interaction
We can use java script and We can check on UI and no need of postman or something 


Postman only for rest API 

Action ...stateless pure component ...no own value 

State to chck ..either return object or error 


Complete ...object
Incomplete ..promise
InBetween...error

When response comes ..it used to check action performed or not ...so state get changed as it is one way communication..Props and state get changed as well...should componenteillupdate method also get called


If all services hosted on 1 server then use dot url ...(.)+url

Create -react -app
Webpack ..bundling files 
Development server ..it's server only
Babel.is compiler 


Npm start means start development server

Const..let..var ...all r constants in react 

Reactdom.render(element,.        )
Above space comments ...in realdom we  have to enter so use plain javascript to render into real Dom

Virtual DOm is memory representation of UI

Import react from 'react' is must 
React element is part of virtual DOm 


We have to render into real Dom  so we have 2 arguments 
First one ..elements
Second ....index.html contains for react application ....use JavaScript to get reference of that element

We render app which contains tree of components


Bootstrap ...it is css library which gives application modern look and feel 


Jxs ..get better code compilation

Simple react snipper ..

Cc ..class components 


jSX expression ..get compiled to calls to react that create element that's why we import react object on top

Import all.componenrs in index.js

Babel don't know what to compile /to create

Automatic semicolon automation

Multi cursor editing ...Ctrl +d 
Dynamic editing ...


Embedding expression ...rather than hardcode value 
{This.state.count}
So we use {} to.render values dynamically 

jSX expression compile.react elements as well ..in jSX we don't have if and else ..jsx is not templating engine 

So to.render elements conditionally we use JavaScript 


Setting attirbutes ..

Tags ...

Empty string is considered as falsy 
String  that has at least one character is considered as truthy

Number O ...false ." ", Null is considered as falsy 
True..Hi ..1 are truthy but result last operand is 1

Handling events ..
Handle increment()
Pass reference to render ()

Onclick ..this .handleincremenr get called

Binding event handlers

_------+++++++++++++++
This in JavaScript behave differently than other languages 
This can refer to different objects

Obj.method 
Function () ..standalone function. 
We use bind method to solve above issue 

Make constructor 
Constructor {
Super()
This.handleincrement.bind(this)
Here this will return current object

Arrow function don't this keyword .

+++++++++±++++++++++

Instead of writing constructor

Handleincremenr =()=> {
Aboves is approach to bind event handlers 
This.setstate()...we need to do this to update status into realdom


All browsers r monkey patched in angular so change automatically updated 

This.setstate (Count.this.state.count+1}


We need to pass arguments to event handlers
Below is inline function
Dohandleincrement=()=>{
This.handkeincrment}



Composing components
Pass data 
Raise and handle events 
multiple components in sync
Functional.componenrs
Lifecycle.hooks

Debugging react apps 


Prop vs react 

Prop..it is data we give to the component 
State ...data that is low or.private to component .it is internal completely to.that component


Sometime component don't have state so it may get all data via props

Prop is read only we cannot change input to component 
We cannot modify prop object as it's read only 


Passing children ...this .proprs .children

Handle click event 
Component that owns piece of state ..should be the one modfying it 


State is private and infernal to component 

Handle delete ..counter 
Ondelte ..counter 

Concept of raising and handling event 

Updating the state ...
Const counter .=this.state.counter.filter

This.setstare..(counter.counters)
We should maintain at one location 

Single.sourxe of truth 
Resetting button counter 

Each counter element have their different storage value
State.lift up...lifting state up
From counter component to.parent component 

Stateless function component (plain javascript function )...which takes proprs as argument and returns a react element

Destructing arguments
Lifecycle hooks

A)Mount ..constructorrender ... render ..componendidmount 

B)Update ..render ...componentdidupdate

C) Unmount... componenwillunmount

When component render all it's children render recursively (fifo)..which is not good scenario as if child component don't have updated value so we have method called as 
Shouldcomponentupdate

Updating phase 

When we render then all children get rendered when component render that doesn't mean entire Dom is updated ..webasically.get react element so we r updating virtual DOm react will.then. Look at virtual DOm ..it also have copy of old.virtual Dom that's why it don't update state directly so we can have 2 different references in memory ..we have old virtual DOm and real Dom then react will see and update based on that and we get updated real Dom 

Component did update ..we compare with new proprs and new state 

Also we can make ajax calls to get new request data from server


==================================================================================

sunday 
 
 The user who is creating file ..he is owner of the file ...tomcat 
I copied tomcat folder so.i am.full.owner
But tomcat internally using java jars 
The user who.installed java might not given permission 

We used to set up in java folder ...these files r available for tomcat 
So I am running application in tomcat so through application we can execute file structure of server 

Generally people used to restrict files /folder etc and mentioned I'm Catalina .policy 
All permission goes in catalina.policy 


Tomcat context.xml is static web.xml



Imp.note ...tomcat is an application as well as server 

Like running application in windows but want to.showcase on Unix so override in context.xml

Logging.properties ..this is logging framework

This is logging framework...


Tomcat manager ...it will.showcase 

Tomcat running status 
What heap size 
Data source 
Application

Server.xml...contains all configuration of running application and load balancing 

In tomcat ..we have shutdown listeners 
8005 ...by default we can change it to.other port 

Hot code swapping ..concept replacing code dynamically without restarting server 

Flat file system ...main frame system work on flat file system 
Uswd to work momentarily 

Suppose 30 lac records a d it take 10-20 mints but in flat file system ..index are there ..it takes few seconds 

Spring batch is trying to replace main frame system 

In java we have concept called as class loader.  It is used to load classes at run time 
Suppose abc.class used to load one method needs to read so we load dynamically


Hcs swapping ..service runs in backend which checks what files running in backend ..it is used to replace files where deployed 
Like abc.clads ..changed things 
Xml file ..server location ..source code package ..destination

Multiple application can run on single tomcat 
It used to give alaram if threads not available for running application

How server came to know that threads r running /created 
So we have listeners which check resource leakage give alarms etc 
Application keeps on creating threads

Here ...
Jre ...global
If we don't give Catalina homepth we cannot use above listeners 

Set of users ..we want to.restrict access of application to some users 
First is ...write some code ..store.permission in db 

Other is server level restriction ..defining set of users ..create instance of server so deploy application to above instance 

Tomcat-user.xml.... we keep roles user/password etc in this file 

Disadvantage of above file is ..we have to restart the system so.maintenance is.high

In tomcat we have configuration to run on Ssl/tls or http 
If running application on Ssl then by default tls should be there 

We can run tomcat on multiple port by configuring server.xml

For load balancing install apache -swrver == mode-jk then we can load balance

How tomcat used to configure mode.jk

Tomcat structure ..bin config lib 
Catalina ...logs 

When you jsp calls then it convert into class and store in work location 


Jsp ...java (intermediate file )...class 

El is expression language 
Tomcat_home ...required 

2 ways to execute tomcat 
One as a service 
Other as command prompt 

Startup.bat ...it is used to search for Catalina_home
Tomcat_home


Full capabilities of tomcat ...then configure all things mentioned in Catalina.bat


Jpda ..it is used for remote debugging
Mentioned in catalina.bat 
Check home ,temp directory 

Application folder not existing at run time
2 ways to add environment variables 

Static way via environment window

Another way to setup via command prompt(dynamic way)



Company don't want to.invest into OS so Unix/Linux as .open soure

 we generally install softwares 
When I run any software it install.temporary files...so in Linux we can restrict folder space 

Like in opt folder ..I want folder  to add only 10gb 
So restricting folder size in Unix 

Port of jdpa ..can be configured but tomcat port cannot be configured 

Suppose multiple tomcat on system only jdpa port can be changed in catalina.bat



React little bit

But for maintains state ..we use action 

Niche technology ..technology which are very hard to find 
Engineer r hard to find 

Bucket technology ..less.people use so.job less so engineer less 

Action are stateless or pure  component 
It has no own value 

State to check ..either return object or error

Complete ...object
Incomplete ..PROMISE 
In-between ...Error

When response comes ..it 


You didn't find comfortable here 

Xhr   is ajax call ...supports asynchronous call 

Axios ..rest API call 

Xhr call ...client side to server interaction 
Postman for rest API only

If all services hosted on one server then use dot url .....(.)+ Url


Sunday notes 
 
 Stackoverflow....possibly when class object continuously loaded into stack/memory so redeployment happening

Tedious task ..


Response from XML is XMl...only issue is parsing 

Marketplace hit request r normal 

Intermittent issue

XML elements comes under name spacing 

We r taking namespace and creating tags 

Create object from.jaxb.xml

JXB. ...LOOKING FOR GENERATION OF CLASS

XML to object ...not working 
XML to class ..exploring 

Nebulazier ..via breathe /nose medicine get passed ...vapours get passed via breathe 


Conversion of XML into xsd
Made java via XML response ..easing 

JXb using for now ...faster way we tried for JXb

Parsing approach taken JXb

XML mapping was not mapped with java object ..due to this thing we converted XML into xsd so we got java file and put into utility so we mapped it properly 


Input stream was not getting closed so we closed input stream as byttearray

XML parsing requires more efforts 
Fails at time of parsing 
At time of reading elements 
At time of streaming /processing input stream 

XML follow Dom structure which is like tree structure  

Below.our cues CMP case 
Order header  ..is root ..after that it will keep on traveling other nodes 

Sequential backup ...which is incremental backup 
Other is timestamp based 

Overall crux is mind will remain good 

It is killing all the time 
Technology side 
Working very very closely with us ...surprizely we got first feedback from.business side 
Definitely it's not throw away work 


I cannot approve things which is not under my radar 

It's undefined rule/pattern in US when person got h1b and bring his wife here then he start looking for new Job

Sometime we have to take.it and follow the things

This is not technology call as this is business call ...they kind of accountable 

We r not able to address all issues ..support intervention is very necessary 

Narrow down the CMP 

Jaxb converters ...

We components ...it is created by Google 
Client side rendering ...work like react ..resumable component 

Widgets ..it is used to create Dom like structure 

Math ...Ml machine learning + AI ..artiticial intelligence


If related classes has no data then it may or may not be problem /issue because as in case of aspect ..we can ignore this error as lazy loading concept is there 

If any high level processing of data is there then we use central system or main frame system to retrieve data 


You have to call out in meeting ...sort of escalation

Can we have 2nd level discussion

Working off hours 

In lie of that particular working day ..will I get combo off

It will be difficult to manage at my end like extra hours to company ..I have some personal work ...want a combo off 

Bit tough for me so pls don't put me in refdata as it impacting my deliveries 

I am doing extra work for you so.things don't get delayed 

Another point of contact 

U need to.mention complexity and necessity of project


Document which is up and ready with you 
Window + left arrow key 

I don't like these sort of words 


Convey XML Gregorian calendar to SQL
CMP should be designed with ease of business not with convenience to technology 

Let me cut the discussion here 

You r welcome to take look and give suggestion that is not negotiable 


This is the only way to go then why not we follow the process 

It will goona  help us and help you

I can accept potentially as a compromise 

Middle ground solution ...win-win for both of us

It's good to challenge people 
What value of dollar you r giving me

509 host nam verifier 

Gethttpclient method ..which willr return httpclient object 

Sslcontextbuilder 

True returns in case of trusted then we build context 

All.certificates present in our cues path then it will put into array x509 certificate 

Separate link for each businesslike 

Time Collides with Dublin

Dollar valuation asking for 

Keeping robotics in mind 
Procure all approvals 

Thinking for everybody has to shake hands and then proceed only then it will take deviation 


It will be interested to know that 
What API we expose we should insert data into database 

Service and adaptor interaction happening 

Down the line ...Shelly will come where r we with fxpb


Cpswebservice ...which will connect to CPS API ...datasource will be created in CpsApi and further communication in 

What will be the response format ..type of data ..format of response 
Use existing standards formats etc 


Fid ...I'd own by team to perform some functions 

We kind of own that space 
It's doable 

It goona work without problem

We kind of train/help taking through entire journey of prod/infra support

Any team connect to our cpsapi via OAuth authentication 

For making call to our API ....they should have a role in our system 
Username /PWD ..authenticated at our end 

Authentication API give role called marketplace 

All APIs have been exposed ..mobile lock /main lock

Cpswebservice...mobile users have access to mobile expect for those applicaiton  which have specific locks 

Role specific authorization not implement ed by Zhang for cues API 

Env ..property of spring framework or we can take as argument

Username and PWD are mandatory ..client address as optional 

Apilock ..details from cache fetched 



User in red color in drop-down are not active 

Validation control point

If backend Api are not ready then  error  and explicitly we r not handling that error 
Because we want error because from that error we know API is not working 


I don't want blame game 

Red amber and green items 

Without certificates we r consuming Api

Migration will.be simple or tricky

Dblink process is handshake process 


I responded in haste 


Order creation. ...bracket issue  
Certificate issue 
XML ...space issue 

If i have missed anything ..can u pls add it


Soft delete ..we cannot it see on UI but dB has entry 
Requirement ..like terminated user ..we want audit history later 


Retention policy ...take atleast I can take my resignation back when I resigned 


CTC ..cost to company 

Cryptocurrency ..mining of money 
Fair currency disadvantages ...notes r  corrupted or account money is dormant


Confuse the hell out of yourself. 

Product  still lived on its seat 

Let's see how development  react to it ..it might be option in future 
It not a show stopper 
We r going to look into opportunity
For.now we can continue 

We r open to suggestions

I don't want noise.up there 

Pls get back to use if you see any anamoly

Next action /timelines 
Required for further analysis 

========================================================================

sat/spring notes
 
 Spring Jms..sunmicrosystem only If I have to pass message from 1 application to another application then use message broker Hundred of application sending message via broker We can acheview this communication vis JMS We can't achieve this communication via webserver ..direct communication Message broker is active mq IBM mq. Rabbitmq. Jboss apachecamel Convert PDF to byte array Application context built on top.of.beanfactory it helps to provide config to application

 We can create object of.interface via anayonmous class

 Flyway application 

Add flyway jar in pom It will search for db creditionals Migration folder ..it will search for version of migration Flyway create ...table ...history...schema Where everything like version is maintained On next execution it won't insert that 

How versioning is maintained Version migration ...checksum version .. description

 Ddl statement...don't have restore point We don't have restore point

 Dml have restore points ..that's why we create logs 

Flyway ..resources ..folder has to be on classpath

 How we r going to maintain version of database It get executed in all environment Non txn and txn data will be different 

Spring used to maintain own txn management 
Txn mode
 Non txn mode

 Txn mode ..managed by data source Non txn mode ... automatically create itself so it is independent rather than dependent on spring Non txn statement ..select queries Txnstatement ...alter ..update ..delete ..insert Multiple txn ...kind of joins Rollback can applied via AOP 


Ajax ...advantages Offers functionality without plugins
 Run on all.platforms 

Disadvantags..every browser handle ajax differently 

Gwt deals with fact that every browser handle ajax call differently Gwt comes with lot of pre- build components Styling is done in CSS Support for inclusion on third party components 

Breakdown of gwt app Rpc call Clientgui > server backened Ajax call (run in browser) 

Java files will be cross compiled and run on browser 
Byte.code run on server

 Gwt ...high level of abstraction 
You can do handwritten JavaScript coding against widget

 Magic of gwt ..it is hosted mode browser 
During development you interact with application and hosted made browser ..run your java bytrcode in backened to render with user interface in embedded browser 

2 benefits 
Because running bytrcode it means we debug any java application ...setting breakpoints. .inspecting through code . We can use json to communicate with server 

We can develop using familar edit. Refresh view programming model of JavaScript Don't need to compile java source into JavaScript to see changes in browser

Gwt provides rpc.mechanism ..no.need to.deal.with low level.http.connections

Google.handle browser implementation differences for us

Create optimized JavaScript files 
Code is contained in browser specific JavaScript

Gwt..webmode .. application translated into.html ..JavaScript code deployed to.webserver 

Power of spring boot is even project setup is taken by spring boot 
Downloading tomcat via jar means by default it comes with tomcat

Autowiring at all.levels ..method ..parameter ..field ...
Application only for runtime 

We can't override in  subclass
.@override ..applicable at source level 

Lifecycle methods or callback methods 

Init ()service destroy() 
Callback methods called by container automatically


Postconstruxt ...predestroy 
Predestroy basically clear the cache

Before using object I want to perform some.operation is done via ostconstruct 
After using object ..predestroy to clear cache




Getting data from map ...it takes nanoseconds


Spring boot ..we r using application context

@qualifier
@singleton
@prototype

@inject
@named
@provider
@scope
@singleton

Annotation means no configuration in XML

Annotations are not recognized by container

Component scan..predefined in spring boot ..by default scan all packages

Autowire means no need to setter method 
Autowiring means ..object is injected into container using spring 

After designing controller ...dao class ..then we have to write test cases 

How to bind xml into java object ...we have xml binding framework

Spring provide module ..spring oxm ...provide mapping between java object to xml



Spring provide another mother for writing test cases .junit test cases

Installing war file in server location ...is not correct approach
Install war file into.maven respository then testing and running 


For context object ...if we r not using spring boot then use component scan 


So 2 ways in spring to configure and detect spring managed component and register with application context  

Component scan 
Context annotation config 

2 ways to load properties
Property place holder configurer
Resource bundle message source

Internalization ..output will come in their region language


To load properties file by using xml annotation. Approach 

Driver class name..fixed for whole application

@value ...is used to get value from property file 

How to configure multiple properties file

Book ticket through irctc
After payment we get null pointer expectiosn means ??
That is possible through dependency check...
Basically I was concept of check which is removed in spring advanced versions

Dependency check in XML

Autowired(required = false)
Gives exception


Transfering data from one layer to another is DTO and that can be in forward and backward directions

Who will bind actual data  so manually we have to set and transfer to another layer in result set (jdbc)

But in case of  spring orm(spring jdbc)
Hibernate will bind automatically

all dto must implement serialization 

Dto vs command object

Html format data bind objects to another format which is command object 

Spring mvc html data is binded with actual data object so we use command object


What are the options to send data from UI to backened 
Json object 
Command object 

Copy data from one object to another object is command

How to create jdbc object and inject object into jdbc template

Jdbc template depends on data source
Data source depends on 4-5 properties 
Driver class name ...url..username ..password etc
 Example 
Student service ...>student dao ..>jdbc template ..>data source ( Driver class name ...url..username ..password)

Runtime spring container will create object of driver class


On top of normal jdbc ...spring people designed one layer ...jdbc 
Spring also uses normal jdbc


Interface A{
M1()

}
A a new A(){
M1()
}

 Above is way to create object of interface 

Insertion 2 approaches 

Hibernate ...by default it create tables
Hibernate mapping to Ddl
If table not available ..it create table 
Hbm2ddl.auto=create

Each and every timr client creating table so.lossing old data table..
Hbm2ddl.auto= update

Rowmapper ..directly we can map.resultset with row number (db table)

Rowmapper ..maps rowdata with single object

How to get data from tables 
Rowmapper ..always expect list of objects...to map row with one object

Result object will point to first row and then iterate
Query method of rowmapper always expect list

In java ..we using dynamically way 
Then we have jdbc template. ??,?? ...? Is position I'd.paramters

Named parameter jdbc template 

Need of maven...getting latest code from respositories like svn ..css

Project ..designed by n developers and developers maintained code in separate repositories


How to get files from.repository that tool is called svn  (version control system)


Building process ...process of compiling source code ..packi.g binaries files and copying files from.one location to another ..getting latest code from.respositories like.svn ...deploying the distribution into server and running junit test cases ..this entire process is build process

Build tools ..ant maven and Gradle 

Drawback of ant ..ant don't provide depenedncy jars...it just download jars and we have to add manually

Maven ..compile ..create war file ..deploy

Maven ..is management and build tool

Where as ant is build tool.only

Broker ..providing communication between producer and consumers

Company ...multiple projects ..I started server in my local.to.test changed and my colleague also doing same at this.maccinr 
We don't know who consume message 

So configure listener install activemq in local
Answer ...we don't have option to.know.how many cosumer consuming
We r dependent on active mq/rabbit mq


Agile methodology ...

RAD ..RAPID ACTION DEVELOPMENT 


WATERFALL ...planning documentation ..design architecture .. implementation testing production 

Disadvantages ...if requirement phase wrong then if changes need to be done then go back to implementation ..so it takes lot.of time ... ..here actually thing is once product is delivered then we fix any new requirement  so by that time like 5-6 year technology becomes outdated 

RAD.... We deliver module by module 
Here first is requirement ..design .. implementation 

Agile ..has no documentation

Let say project has 100 modules 
Each module contain user stories ..then make task and task is converted into.user hours 


Disadvantage ...if developer leave then very difficult to understand as no documentation 

Sprint zero ..next Sprint ..fix previous Sprint o issues 
So.we r fixing all.issues at once so.it will create problem ..develope stress level.is high
Spill over happens ..very common

Advantages ...issues can be recitifed on time ..work is to design ..2 textboxes then we designed 3 texbox

Kanban board

Jpa is specification given by Microsoft
Hibernate is an implementation


All below ORM technology
Hibernate
Jpa
Ibaties 
Toplink

To work with hibernate 
Configuration files 
Mapping files ...no required for jpa or annotation
Pojo classes..persistent
Client application


Spring security project 


Inversejoincolumn ...if u delete user id ..then it delete only that row ...without inverse join column it will delete all rows

Fetch type ..eager ..lazy 

Linked objects ..
If Eager ..when we query user ..user is associated with role and then will link ..so user object retrieved everything 

But in realtime advantages ..we fetched all so performance low

Lazy fetch ..delays initalization. Of resource so increase performance in above scenario


Vi .. visualize any file and perform operation like concatenate ..insert etc

JavaScript advanced version ...jQuery

Document ready .. document load ..page loading 
Page loaded now document is ready 
Document load ..after response but before display on UI

Document ready ..after page loading but if exception nothing shows up

Ajax is command prompt version. Of postman 

Ajax is webservice only

UI debugging and backend debugging 

Spring security 

Oauth2 client ...Gmail and Facebook using this oauth2 client only ....signups/login using fb and google 

Okta ...token based system 

Standardized way to get everything covered related to authorization

Load user by username 


Communication btw Angular  application and java application is intraoperable system 


Microswrvice r also using restcontrollers


Smart development ...in which we all use different environment
1 build will be created 

All environment setup like gitclone And this is achieve d by script..imp point

Then we have smart development
Development setup

Polling concept ..admin will give authorization to you ..to download projects with certification 


Jenkins .. Cicis tools where with single.click it create pipelines on remote and build.war file 

To save time on local setup ..people came out with smart development 
Automating building process 
Automating the deployment process
 
Jenkins ..war created pipeline created

Gradle advantages ..LOC reduced ..any file we execute like Linux ..ksh ..batch like I want to make folder structure in Linux ..then I will chck log files 

Filtering concept 
Json ignore ...filtering concept 
When you don't want to send your SSN dob etc details to server then use filtering concept 

Json ignore ..this is static approach 
Json ignore properties ..value { contact ..datof birth"}
Above is static filtering.

Other is dynamic filtering 
@jsonfilter

Lazy and eager loading 

Hibernate give bydefault ...lazy loading 

At time of loading ..we don't load entire data like video images ...n no of.things ...that is meaningless



Session


Framework design 
Functional and non functional 

Like gwt ...what are the starting class ..basic components ...debug intern.classes
What are things different on gwt 
How we configure 

Exception handling ...checked and unchecked exception

How to handle exceptions 
At framework layer ..how we handle exception 


Synchronized methods ...
==================

Apache jk..used to work.as load balancer

Mode jk ..is a file/module where all config things are defined 
If you want to block up or.provide security via certificates so we can do it and apply on tomcat server level

Instead of buying 4 certificates ..just buy 1 certificate and apply at tomcat server 
So change is done at one server only 
So configuration will easy 

Advantage with rest is it support both xml and json 


Asp application communicate with java application via webservice only 
As we can't share heap memory from 1 application to another 


Spring microswrvice modules deals only with restful services


Soap ..xml only
Rest ..xml +json

Multiple.server ...over the proxy

Soap ...jaxws ...java API for xml webservice..soap.is ri implementation of aixs or cxf ..specification given by sun 

Cxf ...has capability to integrate with spring 

Url.is part of.uri

All beans are managed by spring container 
Spring web framework ..struts is an  alternative  


=======================================

hashmap 

hashmap
 
 Hashmap implement map and extend abstractmap


Abstract map ...also contain similar methods

Above is Generic implementation 

Earlier hashmap internally using arraylist of linked list but in 1.8 they moved to treenodes
 
Reason of move 
Suppose 1 million records.   If search in linear way then consume lot.of memory so use treenodes which use arbitrary algorithm 

Arbitrary  algorithm concept ...whatever data we r inserting in tree  ..root value always more or less than left and right child 

So whenever we have complex scenarios ...we always go for arbitrary algorithms


Data scientist....

New offers /promotions ..company is benefited 
So basically we need to do prediction 
Model trainers 

Machine learning is basically learning on basis of data set
 Task like training model ...how to train model 

Steps
Model .... Data

==============================================

daily2
 
 Cues ..application context /session loaded at time of startup  on Linux boxes /server ....this is Token maintaining at application side ...and 


Session context  ..at time of input of creditionals ..user session

Why we reboot things on server 
Because there is a life of every object
Stale objects wipeout 
Object refreshing


I will not pullback my resignation


Ant build ...is not preferable as we have to keep jars under lib folder always 
No such maven pom.xml way ..to download dependcy on the fly


========================================
cue
 
 Microswrvice architecture ...service will pull data so ...batch tool like CA autosys not required


Mule ...runtime engine of any platform 
It is lightweight ..java based enterprise service bus allow developers to connect application together quickly 

Instance of ...String a = new String ()
here "a" is instance of string ..returns true 


If init ...declared in bean package then it will call that class and initialize thread with fixed rate ...wait till 10 second for one element and put into list 

Factory design pattern.  Class A.   Whenever I call class A then new object instance will be created similarly in string we get( new instance of string ) is created 

Conventions ..client factory.java
New instance should be created of object everytime 


Why we prefer XMl...rendering is very easy and faster than java files 

You know in and out of the project ..then use 2 approaches....start from backened 
...

start from frontend only when (ui we know ) and not sure on business requirement

Back to front ..when we are very sure on business requirement

Client factory ...is used to add details like user profile , realm into presenter layer 


Compare ...when sorting we need to do on basis of 1 column/variable in default order 

Comparator ...sorting based on ID /name /column then use comparator 

Mouse out handlers ...


Menu items ...static menu and dynamic menu 
When select then handlers ..when rendering the menu items an event is called to check if child item are null then cancel all.items 


Why dummynodes are being added at all level other than subaccount level

If it is greater than 3 then use icon (+)
If size =3 then show all 3 



Json format


Metric beat ...lightweight shipper ..can install on server to perdiocally collect metrics
Dialect is something  middleware  between pojo and SQL

Singleton map... Sort of Map...by nature it is singleton 

Only one instance of object will be there throughout application ...updated instance get returned whenever called

Hermes ..

Executor framework ...used to implement multithreading inside state 
When requirement in cache ,, in thread etc...when it is synchronized then it is used to block thread

It is not allowing threads to get data out of it so it will keep blocking threads 


Thread management 


Full pipe and open from.both ends 
It reach upto end of the pipe until anything go out we cannot insert new item


Fixed thread pools ..take out threads from thread pool and put into blocking queue 

Whenever we need increase or decrease blocking queue  we can check active /inactive threads ..memory cost is saved 

When we increase thread size ...suppose reading file which is  using 10 threads so thread size increased ....here increase in blocking queue size is recommended

It is more or less array blocking queue ...linked blocking queue 



Executor framework  ..it is kind of service designed in java ..managing states of thread 
It has many states ..developer always used to face difficulty in managing /creating /stopping threads
So java created framework which will.maintain state of thread ....it is sorry of factory 

Framework taking care of state of thread 

Thread pool will.maintain state of thread 

Threads creation
Extend threads class 
Implement runnable

Callable ...return  always future object
Future objects is returned when callable statement execute

Bank ROI ...(rate of interest )
Is momentic ..all of sudden on any day bank.will.change ROI
If we put this ROI  in code then we need to change functional code changes everytime

It won't allow packages to be downloaded from internet because of vulnerabilities 

PAC URL ...it is configuration we used to define in PAC file ...window specific file 


Pom.xml

Internal and external.jar ...we used to have parent child relationship..download dependencies on.the fly

In react ...generally we r not connecting to database s ..we connect to webservices

Npm install
Npm start


React ...hot code swapping 
Redux ...saga...thunk ...help to switch from one state to another 

Babel ...dynamic loading of pages 

2 ways to define classes 

Stateless ..go for function ..only have render method  (constant don't have its own state )


State method ..multiple function and return type as single component

State is kind of array

2types of hookup

Hookup created at bitbucket ..whenever making call to bitbucket ..we call to hookup...hookup will fetch details


Rest template ..part of spring web 
Whenever we call one webservice to another webservice we need rest template 

Npx ...advanced version of npm

Angular have 2 way data binding if any change then it automatically get changed in objects in controller layer then Dom get rendered as object

Webpack ..is inbuilt server at server side 

==============================

daily 1
 
 Ssh protocol is used to authenticate and establish Sftp connection 


Ways to generate ssh keys


Sizebased trigger policy .....
Timebasedtriggerungpolicy ....at particular interval of time ..it will breakout




In log4j a logger is associated with a package or sometimes with a particular class. Package/class of a logger is defined by the attribute "name". A logger logs messages in its package and also in all the child packages and their classes. The only exception is the root logger that logs messages for the all classes in the application.

A logger also has level and may have one or many appenders (logging destinations) attached to it.

In log 
Target  . .System out ...it will print on console 

Root level ...it will log messages for all classes

,


Gemfire server

Framework design 

Gwt customized ...in CPS/cues ...like grid ..we just use objects and we get grid 

But if we have to design Citi/company specific 

Grid we customized based on CPS and cues separately  this is part of core framework 

So later on further 3-4 year guy can build the UI etc as he can use framework method/objects


Rest can accept TCP ..http ..https etc



Threads using as I can  see run method in class

Class file ...has main method means it will run whole file as java and we can see test results 

Multiple junit test cases in one class ..we can test separately given No main method in class


Azure certification ..if we comparing AWS .
SNs ..notification service

Mongodb ...we made commands..we pass keys

====================
ref notes 
 
 Sock.js ...an API used for real time updation like  Chatting application

It create socket between  Client and  server ...whatever data coming from server it keep on updating data t client side /UI


Comet is a Framework which also work like this


Sockets applied at UI which continuosly capturing data from server


Scheduler can be scheduled at java end as well ...check code

Schedulers r applied at java end and


========================================

notes ... important
 
 Data center we access remotely 

Server should be kept in minimal temperature

Microsoft , Facebook Cisco ..server have low energy server 

1 laptop take 40-50 watt
If any heavy program ...CPU usage is high ..multiple threads 

Thread 1 ..... Data taking from hard disk 
Thread 2 ....sequence data 
Bits and bytes 

Like example MP3 player ... sequence of bytes 
Stream ...keep on reading ...thread running internally

One thread running by consumer ...MP3 client 

Thread 3 .. taking data from datasource 

Raid disk ..these r on demand hard disk which requires no change to existing server 

2 types 
Application server like CPS /cues 
Data server like log screen ..storing data into harddisk

1 server having 1 tb harddisk  internally swapping swap space 40gb 
When 40.gb fall in

My app generates 1 tb of log every year and harddisk gets filled after 5 years so we will add external raid hard disk so it automatically add space to existing harddisk

Smart TV ... HDD FTP access 

Router is to route the things 

Advanced router work as FTP server ...making. To internet and can access to shared harddisk 

Goldman Sachs ..only cooperate dealing 
Top notch ...highest quality
Society generate 
Snake bit . ...Bite on  tongue ..few hours of sleep 

Dialect ..intermediate btw pojo and database

Multiple beans of same type ..we have to use one of them then use quailifer instead of autowiring 

Common logging is internally using log4j


Slf4. .part of spring framework

Commong logging ..abstraction layer on top.of log 4j

Sl4j contains log4j

3 types of radar 

Automobile 
Defence 
Airline 

Radar is used to showcase the things within its range ..used to track the things 
But for defence system radar range is too high 

Radar are setup in areas of jungles 

Public area like highway etc ..less obstacles as surrounded by greenery
Less accident ..high performance

Gwt design is like server is equal to client proxy 


We do event handling only on presenter layer

Margin setting in gwt at server side but all new technologies like react etc at client side 


Change the witdth from UI downscreen to get numbers /idea because gwt text box checkbox created at server side but in new technologies all checkbox txtbox created at client side 

 First inspect then do code changes 
Adjust and see difference on UI ..then go back and set into eclipse 

Overflow ...width .
Here width is overflowing so it will keep in container only

Noclassdefined error ..means it's not getting class 

Profileproxy ..we maintain at client side 

Profileproxy used for server interaction
Server side ...original object we maintain

2 types of session 

Application context ..at time of application load
User session context ..when user login 

Session I'd ..part of user context 

List can be intialized Via arraylist  only like 

List a = new arraylist ()

Every method in implementation class will be overridden 
Given method declaration in super class 

Http client utl ..in profile gui is a way we making call to cpswebservice 



Thumb rule ..every interaction of service with other system require session

Data we have to set for user in session ..getusercontext()

Session I'd ..get from authentication class


10gb logs ..need to iterate those logs and split it on basis of server id



Elk Vs lucence

All.of sudden manager said fraud happend ..want to see logs of

So make intermediate application connecting to multiple application which will connect to all services /gui etc and generate logs at one place ...so all logs at one place

Post is used for insertion as well as updattion 
Http client sort of client where we can post request to server 

Object JSON ..

Multi layered data so we cannot pass Map 
Map (string string ) ...so we will make object to pass it 
Object to.json ...we can pass JSON as part of header in client request 

JSON is key value pair 

Header ..we can pass data as key value pair only

Why gson ..because JSON request body is complex structure 

Generic jars ...no class defined found error 

? Means files doesn't exist in bitbucket but created while compilation /build of projext

Team ...show in history ...compare with local.history 

.git ignore file ...to ignore change 

Either java files not getting compiled due to which we r not getting class files out of it so class definition error ...noclassdefination error

Drill down ...means customizing the default behaviour/ properties of httpclient 
Qtpse7kp-79 ...thread I'd in logs 

Removed context as it was searching additional.info like certificates

Live validation where set of business and testing users are involved 

X509 certificate comes in case of SSL

Stackoverfloe ...possibly when class object



i get things easily but actualztion things later is diffciult for me 



=============================================================

notes2
 
 Auto FS ...service used to clean things at linux server for mounting purpose ..it is sort of client side service Want to access some directory not.present in server ..it will create file/folder on server 

In case of NAS ..any hardware added ..no.need to.stop cues/CPS services Team and CYBERARK not applicable to application level 

All system are not centralised When window creditional.get changed ..everywhere creditionals get updated ,

LDAP is centralised authentication system CYBERARK is being managed similarly like ldap Pojo class cannot contain logs Happy path ..normal flow 

Daily rolling file appender ..logs runs for 24 hours Info ..less logs Debug has more logs 2method .. serialization and deserialization Timeframe ..minimum load we choose Table structure can be made in cache regions


 LLC ..set of libiality is fixed by companies Company opened ..show liability of 50 lak And 30 lak can be granted from gov Turnover cannot be exceeded by 1 core Mainframe..consider as super computer ..started developing things on mainframe system .. Springboot way Yml ...parent child relationship Server.yml ... Server : Properties :ABC Port :1222 But in application propters ... Server.url Server.propertis 

Just difference is declaration difference Profiling ..Dev uat .. prod sit etc 4 projects ..started Poc ...have some poc Worked on warehouse application Provide link ...sample creditionals 


Bkp ..backup file Class path variables ... 

$ ..Linux class path variables Claspath variable Linux echo Linux way ..to get class path Echo $name(you see) .

Bash_profile...contains class path of user ..when I login to Linux env ..it usually create this bash file and create and maintain claspath of that user User variable ..user specific System variable ...system specific Linux path variable concept Pega ..niche technology Deployment can be done using internal users only ..internal path Some case where some internal users cannot use deployment directory or some specifi folder So we use other way like copying in EERS ..DATA GET copies from EERS to epgadm Views are expose to other services ..won't add columns Gettwrsetter always in camel case Boolean always ...isboolean Debugging UI...f12 ..under elements ..set property Chokidar 2 ..FS events ..which used to create issues related to system hardware Search component used to get rendered inside high level component Hoc ..highlevel component One component can be rendered We used to create auxiliary component ...ie high level component We used to create dummy component ..wherever child passing Arraypassing into highlevel.order So we will.get object of high level component Hoc is advanced technique in reactjs React only return one value ..if we need to return multiple values or form then we used to create high level order component Response body is high order component ..we use any value ..single ..multiple null array etc Same case with react PARRRS... react select drop-down Search.js ..fetch client ..users FIFO ..recursion .. Npm -g install ..g stands for global -g ..add in claspath Npm works on particular application version Java has so many versions..at time of design we define version of java etc Incase of failure ..what is the next step ..2nd step ..All Thinking at time of framework designing Webapp folder is always inside tomcat Deployment is always from webapp folder Jndi works with all either it is database ..tibco Excel travsering /filing concept Top.level hiearchary 4 objects ...workbook ..sheet ..rows ..cell Once we get sheet ...skip 1st row as it's header Means u have to count the cells in header then iterate header if ABC found in header Resiliency testing 70. 80% of applicaiton use mongodb as intermediate database ..only 3-4 dB are reliable dB in market and considered as stable version SQL server .oracle ..Sybase Paging concept ...Offset ...sort of wording we use when we fetch data from database .. Offset =limit =count of data pulling/sending like 100 Deep cloning or deep copy is same SXSSF ..STREAMING CONCEpt .IF Data needs to fetch from database and I want data to be added hand to hand And generally we used to out intermediate data in map/list but in case of bulky data mapoverflow so ssytem get failed or performance issue So to increase performance we are making intermediate objects and putting data hand to hand Permission is toggle functionality ...like ON or OFf Cherry pick ...no of commits on particular commit I'd we can fetch particular commit ...cherry pick can be done at both local and remote side Debugging alternative way ...use Java agent in eclipse for class files Useful for project which takes lot of time for debugging Absolute path ... Full path Canonical path .. Here is a canonical path. C:/files/foo.txt Here are absolute paths C:/files/FOO.TXT C:/files/FOO.txt C:/files/foo.TXT C:/FILES/FOO.TXT Canonical path is a absolute unique path to a file Reading file in java ...fileinputstream..fastest way to read Dot is period sign Splitting won't work on period sign so use ("\\.) UTf-8 ..log file and text file have code in scanner New scanner (input stream "utf-8") In general project we used to pass Map ,list but here in Citi we are passing properties files ABC: 123 Def: 456 Cuz : 781 Key 

,value ..XML or map.or.list

 Until I am.not changing version number obsivoly new jar object not get deployed Why we delete mav_repo because it download from.local 

Maven possible errors Delete from ...

maven-repo Checking setting.xml Check group id dependency Maven .- repo after 1st build it always get downloaded from local and same work in remote Claspath ..project path ...add dependency separately Whenever we working on ssl ..we have to pass certificates whatever content we pass Server.xml has SSL configuration Need a week to test it out React and java application works together ...both have to run parallels Standard we should not put main applicaiton page into index.html Index.html Weblogic.xml


 Cors ...cross origin resource sharing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. ... For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. Every server has its own way to.implement cors policy 


Swapping the URL of dB will.be easy way to connect to Dev /uat Here profilegui is.not allowing data to be consumed by react which is CORS Patch 


concept ... configuration on your local ..so patch is being shared Configuration are created as patch file Apply that patch to code at server side If doing at local ..configuration get changed at local server as well So patch file is configuration file Httprequest filter under network... Packet transfer issue ..latency issue Make build ready for react applicaiton and put into java application Npm run build 

There are many ways to redirect the output 
Console 
File Buffer-clipboard

 Iterating header and checking value coming in header or not Atomic integer ..used in concurrent environment ie multithreading Atomic integer ..used by multiple threads at same time for increment purpose Location count ..is to check on which column no, value -1 At which location it exist Location exisitvaluesearch For.now we r doing stringsearch only In and out parameters .. In parameters. We pass to so Out parameters.



We get from so Ddilegacy certificates..access certificates.. applicaiton which are accessed via certificates only Jython ..java implementation of python Diamond sign










========================================================

tectia ..java api  

log file from remote swrver via java code and out into particular folder ..once it is located we will reqr that file and search required content 
instance of ..is comparison operator 

jsch ..user name pwd to get session
.ssh .
1st way  .we used to create session private key and public key
2nd way is to create session via user name pwd 


sftp progress monitor ..we can check to monitor file transfer progress
batch move...for downloading multiple files

download multiple files using ftp via java 
winscp is a windows based so we used batch

tectia is linux so we are going via java api


beans lifecyle ..we used to 

applocaiton context is more advanced vrsion of beanfactory 
all.beans get laoded into aplicaiton context ioc ar time of startup and where beans get seggragated as we have beans differentaion..like singleton ,,session ,protype


chaning concept ..one method get executed following other method execution etc 
1->2 soon 


when we parse values into java ..no case of value coneverted in java but in grails we have value contverted so it will update( : )everywhere

If one file to.change which takes another hour to build/deploy process so for.this purpose we use java agent debugging way


Difference between listener and aspect 

Http request ...controller call..I added aop logic ..so aop excecuted when controller got processed

Once per request listeners ..when request fire it execute ..listener got executed 





Difference between observables and promises 


Observables and promises comes under react and angular 

API call from UI ..we intially return promise object in react

Promise handle one service request 
Observables handle multiple service request 
Both are asynchronous in nature



============================

interview 
 
 Working.on same payroll...tough to.survive


Ur ownership is lacking

If u see something  always say something

Need to discuss with you ...nowadays things are very tensing 

Need favour from your ..what exactly my current status in grabbing fte .it will be great for me

2 ways to print special characters

JavaScript ...&gt and Lt is equal to <>
ASCII way ..&#39(asiic value) === () ..

Paas and saas

Citi cloud services 
Private ..on premises and offpremises

Paas.. onpremises

Onpremises..very costly ..company folks will.come onsite and install setup env and licence will be given
Offpremises...cloud hosted where AWS will be managing from their location
Pay per monthly/weekly/usage 


Onpremises ...3 level.encyrption

User level
Basic encryption..public and private 
Middle.level ..cryptographic

CGI ..process when single txn session is created ..if btw logging with other machine ..txn will.be declined very few banks are following 

Swift transfer r not.momentic 
Intermediate services r running and validating 24x7


Before hibernate static and dynamic query r into java which creates problem like big joins ..multiple joins ..big codes 
To solve this problem ..we out into xml and we make parser 
<Query>..key value form.pair 
So if any problem in query we used to.get error.in beginning when application get started ...xml parsers used to parse xmlr
Collection r very fast .


Cpsclient using query builder 

Advantage is while loading application we got all queries 
Loc is less 
SQL injection attack is less as we r using SAX parser to parse queries (Citi parser )..chck

?,% %. ...instead of parsing into SAx parser ..we pass into.queries ..as parser don't allow special character 

Closable httpclient ...once request get completed means when response recieve then httpclient will close the session object 

2 ways to create logger 
Logger factory 
Logg


Niche technology ...it can be new or outdated 
Very few person available in market 
Ofbiz ...high paid salary 

ERP... Enterprise resource planning 

All work within organization can be handled via ERP like warehouse .production ..repository ..attendence


Trigger are used to modify /update other tables when any insertion deletion modification happens 

Trigger degrades performance so we don't prefer... general ly we used to fire batch queries ..if one table needs to be updated then only that code execute via batch 

Workflow system ..which keeps on checking if any udpation is.therr ...it will update tables 
As it work as a scheduler 

No load on DB 
No code break on system

Hibernate don't have concept of trigger 
But we have cascading effect which is sort of trigger So queries will have cascading effect because of hibernate 

Flex /JSF ..UI component both came in market at same but jsf was successful but flex was not 

Techstack migration .. version migration 
All upgrading system 

All add * sp will be called when ther is update or insert in tables ...

At level 3 ...groups can be created 


Defragmentation alogrithms ..piecing together 

2*n ...block size  allocated at different location 
Memory of sys objects 
Algorithms which is used to allocate memory 

Time to time ...internal system used to run defragmentation to get sequential memory 
Search capability will be reduced 
So we add defragmentation to.make sequential 

Neo4j...it is server as well as desktop APi 
Find out bulky data from text files 

It is used for crawling and analysis artificial intelligence as well 
Jenkins.pythons

Grace(it's kind of JVM) ..it is VM middleware ...groovy

Mature platform...on top.of this ...php...groovy ..java . We can run this 

For java we need to.install JDK

So if grace is installed then we can run php ..groovy ..kotlin


N number of classes in java file but only one public class in one java file 

Inner class concept ...
Public class name .......a.b.class
A.class  A.b.c.class

Why many classes get created 

2 objects exist in java file and these objects are called in 
So.these classes can be easily referenced 

Inner class or nested class is a class declared entirely within the body of another class or interface. It is distinguished from a subclass.

Performance testing tools ..grafana ..kibana 
Apache famous tool ..Jmeter 
To hit application by 10k users at same time 

Automation testing ..
Path changes 


One user ...multiple session 

Multiple users ...update of single property ...multiple user at same time 

Single.user ..multiple.session 

Snipping or tapping 

Payment to Sachin via paytm UPI ..at same time ..tap request to another API ..he is redirected via same API
This is an overall Crux 



============================================================================================

Eclipse plugin for react development

Sonar cube..static code analysis

Dev and SIT we don't generally  go to Sonar cube 

For uat ..we go and deploy to sonar cube server and see vulnerabliyties report file


Feign ..declarative web service client Postman is service client for.testing restful services 

But in java if we want to call rest service go for feign Feign client ...balance the load /request Spring boot 

ribbon ..clientside load balancing with ribbon If one instance busy ribbon with ask to.point to another instance Let say services cs1 cs2 C's 3 running Ribbon will call 

Microswrvice ...small.rest service Alternative of rest template is feign 

Ribbon drawbacks .....I don't want to maintain all 3 instances ..only.maintain 1 so remove configuration 3 urls etc 

Above drawback.of ribbon.is resolved in microswrvice via eureka naming server 

If u want to opt out the instances then configure url in properties files If u want to opt out the instances then configure url in properties ...fixed by eureka naming server Problem in ribbon ..hardcode values /url.in properties file 

Solution is ENS .eureka naming server Which is rest based server used in AWS cloud services for load balancing and failure of middle services 

Devtools ..to restart server 

Acutator ..for monitoring purpose 

Discovery server ..when service is up it used to register the discovery server and can take all rest calls 

Ribbon will be responsible whether request will go to 8080 ,8081,8082 etc Naming server ...contain all services configuration used for discovery server 

Ribbon API run on top of naming server 

Gone for good and left and not coming back It has gone for toss...means service has stopped working

 In spring we go for component scan to go particular /class so it register everything with application context

 But in spring boot it automatically scan everything 

Single sign on ..many below approached LDap Same Oauth2 Kerberos 

Filters ..filter is configured based on filtertag Like . Filter can take request and so as servelt can take request as well But normal.xml can't take request so that's why filter is mandatory
